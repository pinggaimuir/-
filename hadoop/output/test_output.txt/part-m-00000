it was morning in early september and senior investors at carmignac the french fund manager were engaged in a debate that they had been having for months just how fragile was the world economy
now digesting the impact of an august decision by the chinese authorities to let the value of the renminbi drop only slightly it was finally time to act
they would effectively pull out of the stock market and wait to see what happened
after a vicious sell-off markets recovered their poise and in december the us federal reserve was sufficiently confident about the outlook to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade
but in recent weeks carmignac's decision has looked like the right call january has been a disaster for stock markets which have never fallen so far or so fast at the start of a year
"our interpretation of the chinese accident was that this is the canary in the coal mine that this is the first material impact of the end of quantitative easing" says didier saint-georges strategist for the french asset manager
global stock markets have lost over $==NUMBER==tn of value already this year
the fears about china's economic slowdown and depreciating currency have erupted into near-panic
chinese stocks in shanghai and shenzhen have lost a fifth of their value in the first two weeks of january
benchmark indices in japan and europe and the us have fallen by as much as ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
commodity prices have tumbled downwards with oil selling for less than $==NUMBER====NUMBER== a barrel a price last seen in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==4
a spiral of pessimism is developing with prominent strategists and investors telling clients to pull out of stocks and head for the safety of government bonds
alongside worries about slowing growth in china investors are concerned about weakening us corporate profits the health of mining groups and energy companies that took on debts when prices for raw materials were far higher and the consequences of collapsing energy prices
so us investors will return on tuesday after a long weekend looking for the answer to a question what can restore confidence not just to china but to the rest of the world
at stake is the credibility of policymakers around the globe in particular the fed which last month raised overnight borrowing costs for the first time in a decade
notably the us central bank delayed a widely expected borrowing shift last september after the market turmoil triggered by china's surprise devaluation of the renminbi
"the fed will find it much more difficult to raise rates now with equities down ==NUMBER== per cent this year oil making new lows and concerns increasing that inflation will take even longer to reach the ==NUMBER== per cent target'' says arthur bass managing director at coex partners
the challenge facing policymakers is that investors continue their exit from commodities shares and corporate bonds spurring a stampede that hurts confidence among companies and consumers
after the financial crisis central banks took exceptional measures to stimulate their economies but growth has been disappointing
the fed is supposed to have closed the door on the post-crisis era but with interest rates still close to zero and scant prospect of fiscal stimulus the worry is that policymakers have exhausted the tools available to them
some argue market turbulence will force the authorities in china to pull together a package of stimulus measures before the chinese new year on february ==NUMBER== when markets close for at least three days and business slows down
yet the concern is that a viable package of measures needs more time to be put together with china's credibility already dented by its apparent hasty actions from forced stock-buying by the so-called "national team" last summer to the abandonment of "circuit breakers" which imposed trading halts on plunging stock markets this month
"what announcement can they make they've made a lot of them already" asks xingdong chen chief china economist at bnp paribas "cutting reserve ratios doesn't seem to be working in the way that they'd want can they say they're using a speculative vehicle in the stock market
attempts to manage the renminbi have only added to concerns
the people's bank of china has continued to spend foreign currency reserves to protect the renminbi and intervened in markets to narrow the gap between the offshore exchange rate and the onshore rate it controls
for now hopes for a confidence boost from beijing in the near term may be misplaced as many seasoned china watchers say that authorities in beijing will be loath to introduce anything radical before the meeting of g==NUMBER====NUMBER== central bank governors in mid-february
china is the host of this year's meeting and has a record of suppressing market volatility in the lead-up to events where it will be in the spotlight
in the absence of action investors in the rest of the world may be tempted to take a lead from the chinese stock markets
george magnus associate at oxford university's china centre and a senior economic adviser to ubs argues a chinese economy growing at ==NUMBER== or ==NUMBER== per cent a year while far slower than seen in the past decade would not be a problem for the rest of the world
"it's been very fashionable to equate financial turbulence with a global recession around the corner but i don't think that's correct"
still the direction for china is just one of the larger issues facing investors
"the level of uncertainty visible in markets can be traced to two sources china and oil" says craig botham emerging markets economist at schroders "and both have been extremely difficult for investors to call which is why no one is sure what the end point of this is.
following the decision of western authorities to lift a number of sanctions against iran global oil prices fell to a ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-year low yesterday putting further pressure on developing economies that rely on exporting commodities
"we're seeing lower capital spending in emerging markets and high yield credit weakness in the us yet we're not seeing the consumer boost that low oil prices might provide" says mr botham who sees in market movements "a lot of worry about the weakness of the global trade recovery"
indeed standard & poor's counted ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== corporate bond defaults last year the most since ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==9
stress at indebted companies also rose significantly in the past six months with the biggest increase in the proportion of companies judged to be at risk of a downgrade to their credit rating in six years
the us stock market is also said to have narrowed a sign of a market running out of momentum after years of upward movement
indeed equities corporate debt and government bonds are all pricing in a ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent chance of a recession this year according to jan loeys a senior strategist at jpmorgan who argues sentiment has become too pessimistic and detached from the reality of economic data
"if we are indeed in the last inning of the us expansion and within half a year of recession then the current sell-off of risk markets makes sense but that development is not our view" he wrote in a report this weekend
a procession of good economic data including employment figures for the us economy due on february ==NUMBER== could start to restore confidence among investors
that is echoed by jan hatzius of goldman sachs who highlights the weak links between china and the us and europe
even in mr hatzius's more adverse scenarios where chinese growth slows sharply from goldman's already pessimistic ==NUMBER== per cent current estimate well below the official forecast of about ==NUMBER== per cent the global impact is painful but manageable and far from enough to plunge the world into a new recession
after a difficult first ==NUMBER====NUMBER== trading days of the year this is perhaps the most favourable outcome for investors one in which the problems they see do not disappear but are at least contained
in this scenario commodity prices are a reflection of excessive boom-time investment by the industries that mine and pump them rather than a slump in global demand
low global interest rates will ultimately spur a steady recovery in economic activity
and china's pains reflect the transition from a rapidly industrialising nation to a society whose economy is driven by services and domestic consumption
it is possible that markets signal a very difficult year for investors and crisis-stretched policymakers without implying imminent disaster
"china is a bit like a shakespearean tragedy" says mr magnus "you know what happens in the end it's just a question of how many acts it takes to get there.

for ==NUMBER====NUMBER== years china has prospered thanks to a low-wage high-investment growth model--one in which workers see only a fraction of the fruits of growth and corporate profits are plowed back into ever greater capacity
that model though is changing the recent strike over unpaid social insurance payments that affected an adidas and nike supplier in southern china shows how workers are becoming more aggressive
if china successfully manages to move from an investment-focused economy to a consumption-based one such a shift will have an impact on the rest of the world too
that's especially true for the us which has long ginned up its own consumption by selling treasury bonds and other assets to foreign investors
these are the issues stephen roach a former chairman of morgan stanley asia who is now at yale's jackson institute for global affairs examines in his book unbalanced the codependency of america and china
america needs to start saving more he says while china needs to start serving its own consumers -- starting with a better social safety net
edited excerpts
there's a lot of misinformation and outdated views about china in the uS
it looks at excess investment or low consumption or rising debt and concludes that china is doomed
the us misses the fact that china not only has a different system but it also is at a totally different stage in its development
it's certainly facing some daunting problems but moving from a producer model to a consumer model built on urbanization still requires very high investment ratios
it still requires an active government promoting state-directed infrastructure and real estate construction
we can't rely on our own model to assess china's progress or lack thereof
most developing economies do get caught in the middle-income trap largely because they stick with the same model that led them from early-stage development to middle income and they think it can provide the impetus for moving to higher income -- and it usually doesn't
china's changing the model which is important and so i'm optimistic china is on a course to escape this dreaded trap
one word strategy
strategies don't always work but all economies need some form of strategy
we operate on a very short-term basis
that constrains us from being proactive and planning for the future on issues like saving us competitiveness and how to address income inequality
we don't have courageous leaders who are willing to take those risks
that bubble burst and they're left with no savings
the saving rate now is close to ==NUMBER==% versus a ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-year average of about ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% at the end of the last century
it's as low as it's ever been for any leading nation in modern history
we need to expand existing incentives like ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==-ks and iras we need to provide savings incentives explicitly for low-income individuals
then we need to address the current unsustainable monetary policy in which zero interest rates have crushed returns for a generation of savers
these policies were put in place in the depths of a horrific crisis
they were emergency measures
the emergency is long over and yet the policies are still on emergency settings
when excess liquidity gets combined with what's still a weak economy with considerable slack in labor and product markets the odds suggest that it shows up in asset markets either at home or abroad
it's a recipe for instability in financial markets and for potential future bubbles
which bubbles they are no one knows
you emphasize that china needs to provide more in the way of social benefits if it is to bring down its very high saving rate
do you think america's welfare state is adequate -- or over-generous it's not perfect we have massive unfunded liabilities in both our retirement system and in healthcare but we at least have a well-defined system of contributions and benefits
china doesn't have that
the lack of a well-funded and secure safety net both for healthcare and retirement is a main reason why the saving rate is excessively high for chinese households and continues to go higher
that will impede a consumer-led transformation
so much so that in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== china was the third most popular destination for globally mobile students at higher education level according to the institute of international education the us-based non-profit research and information body
"in the old days first they had to learn chinese" she adds
attracting ==NUMBER== per cent of the ==NUMBER====NUMBER==m world total of globally mobile students china is snapping on the heels of the uk which has ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of the total
the us is the most preferred destination with ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of the pie according to the latest project atlas report on student mobility from the iiE
in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== when the iie first started compiling its data china did not figure in its top eight country list
certainly provision of business education in english in china appears to be accelerating
this month the chinese university of hong kong will welcome the first students on its shenzhen campus just across the border from hong kong
the undergraduate students have been able to choose from programmes offered by the school of management and economics as well as science engineering and humanities programmes
the shenzhen initiative follows hot on the heels of london business school's announcement in june that it would team up with fudan university in shanghai to teach a double degree masters in management programme from september ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==5
the high profile tie-up adds to fudan's other alliances with leading western business education providers including mit sloan school of management and the olin business school at washington university in st louis both in the us bi norwegian business school the university of hong kong korea university business school and nus business school in singapore
also in june came the news that cornell university's johnson school and tsinghua university in beijing would be teaching a double degree mba together
similarly duke university's fuqua school of business has just launched its first programme from its joint venture with wuhan university in kunshan a city in jiangsu province just west of shanghai
duke follows early movers such as the university of nottingham which has just celebrated the ==NUMBER====NUMBER==th anniversary of the launch of its campus in ningbo a city on china's east coast
the school's website boasts that its masters programmes attract participants from more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== countries
other schools have also dipped their toes in the water without making a commitment to establishing a full-scale campus
but with all this increase in english language business education provision there are some concerns about the quality and content of what is being taught and questions about its long-term impact
"foreign schools could risk diluting their brand value" says michael pettis professor of finance at guanghua school of management at peking university he says some prestigious schools are setting up shop in a manner not unlike how a french fashion label might open a boutique in a wealthy area of beijing or shanghai
prof bastin who has taught in china since the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s says overseas business schools have a particular advantage
ceibs in shanghai which is ranked ==NUMBER====NUMBER==th in the ft global mba ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== ranking attracts large numbers of international students
established in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== as a joint venture between the chinese government and the european commission the autonomous school is also able to pick from among the best chinese applicants
"china is becoming more and more part of the world economy and the need for ambitious individuals to communicate with the outside world is increasing" says hellmut sch tte dean of ceibs he says china needs the international business education that it is now trying to encourage and that it benefits both overseas and local chinese students to have that education provided in english
"foreign participants bring the urgently needed cross-cultural dimension into the classroom" he says adding that chinese is not a language students can learn in a few months
however the rapid opening of china's education system to foreign influence could bring its own dynamic prof pettis points out
for prof bastin the answer could be interesting
"you can't have the sort of education system we have in the west without political change" he says
in may the haas school of business at university of california berkeley launched an executive level programme to provide what it calls a "silicon valley perspective on business innovation and leadership" tailored to senior chinese leaders
this takes place at the china executive leadership academy pudong 
"i'm trying to maximise the long-term reputation of berkeley haas it's ultimately about reputation" says prof lyons adding that celap's students are particularly influential
the may cohort of students he says included "a bunch of chinese vice-ministers"
top of the curriculum list was sustainable urban development
financial risk management and entrepreneurship were also popular
"china's low-cost advantage has been eroded labour costs have gone up so you have to turn to creativity and innovation and you need to turn to business education to help that.
overseas institutions who do get it right will gain immeasurably in the long run he says
every organisation has ghosts
not shrieking spooks exactly but the sort of behavioural ectoplasm that clings to companies long after change has supposedly swept through
spectres of past successes haunt the board and frighten investors while staff in pursuit of new goals have to wade through psychomagnotheric slime to get there
ghost structures and habits are particularly persistent at established companies
but newer groups also need ghostbusters
twitter which continues to tinker with its hierarchy and misfiring model is a good example of a company still spooked by the spirit that first enlivened it
exorcists should always be on standby at start-ups where behaviour that seemed fresh in the first phase of growth often reeks of recklessness by the second or third round of funding
two big problems stand in the way of ghostfinders-general
as leaders of the organisation they were often the champions of the type of behaviour that now holds it back
"we're asking them to change the things that got them there in the first place" says jonathan trevor of oxford's sad business school
the second related problem is that outmoded habits are often the same as the ones that knitted the old organisation together
these informal frameworks are sometimes referred to as "truces" uneasy coalitions between feuding factions based on embedded routines
end the truce and you end the fragile peace
"habits become institutionalised a set of routines procedures and rules which define us and give us identity" sir anthony salz wrote in his ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== report into how barclays' business practices went bad "everyone defends their identity.
there is no real reason why as a columnist i should be at my desk as the first edition print deadline nears but here i almost always am
pressing technological change makes it even more urgent to know how to end the haunting
a pre-internet episode from citigroup's history shows how
when john reed then chief executive of the banking group sought to tackle a crisis in commercial real estate that took the company to the brink of collapse he needed several goes to make the changes that saved it
despite the depth of the problem mere exhortation did not work
he had to break the structure by getting rid of the three executives who oversaw fiefdoms outside his control and destroy ingrained bad habits
to cut costs for instance he scrapped bonuses but also forbade staff from using cover sheets on faxes  told them to take taxis not limousines and started charging for canteen meals
the signal was clear
as he put it in a private memo "much of this waste is habit a style issue of how we have grown to run the place'.
we need the courage to change our ways and embrace them.
mr reed opened his private correspondence to sarah kaplan of toronto's rotman management school for a recent study
the amount people are paid sends one signal
at barclays the salz review found that "pay contributed significantly to a sense among a few [investment bankers] that they were somehow unaffected by the ordinary rules"
more important though is to change the stimuli that affect behaviour
as prof trevor has written whether the strategy purpose and structure of companies are aligned often makes the difference between a good organisation and a bad one
expunging phantasms is essential but not enough
leaders also need to make new truces lest the dead hand of past behaviour strangles new ways of working
a new pentagon forecast showing the total cost of owning and operating a fleet of f-==NUMBER====NUMBER== joint strike fighters topping $==NUMBER== trillion over more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== years has caused a case of sticker shock in washington
and that price tag doesn't even include the $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion the defense department will spend to purchase ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== of the stealthy planes through ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==5
during a senate hearing this month sen john mccain called the $==NUMBER== trillion figure jaw-dropping particularly when compared with the costs of operating other aircraft
i appreciate this estimate is still early and subject to change but we need to know that the program is going to bring that number down he said
the long-range estimate is by its nature imprecise because it attempts to forecast factors including inflation and fuel costs decades into the future
and the pentagon says it will be adjusted as the planes enter operation
but the figure is bringing new scrutiny to what is already the pentagon's largest-ever weapon-buying project as its budget comes under pressure
christine fox head of the pentagon's cost-assessment office said in senate testimony that the f-==NUMBER====NUMBER== would likely cost about ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% more per flight hour to operate than two of the aircraft it will replace the f-==NUMBER====NUMBER== and f-==NUMBER==8
the marine corps version of the f-==NUMBER====NUMBER== will be able to hover and land vertically
the navy model will operate from aircraft carriers while the air force version will be based on land
developmental aircraft are flying and the first f-==NUMBER====NUMBER==s -- which cost about $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million each -- are slated to enter service later in the decade
the pentagon's forecast includes all the possible costs the military might incur over the lifetime of the program including everything from housing the aircraft to installing replacement parts
add all those together and factor in inflation mr burbage said and you trip the trillion-dollar mark
but he said the question to ask is is that a relevant number
the joint strike fighter has long been a troubled program with cost overruns military management shake-ups and heightened political scrutiny but lockheed says the aircraft is now ahead of schedule on its test flights
speaking to reporters tuesday lockheed chairman and chief executive robert stevens said the trillion-dollar figure was derived from a new pentagon selected acquisition report that wasn't developed by the company and said the company would work to find ways to bring down the aircraft's long-term production and sustainment costs
as big as that number is there are sufficiently large opportunities to reduce that number by making streamlining decisions along the way he said
on days like yesterday there is little to do but wait for the casualty count at the end
even with the us on holiday the sell-off was the worst single day for global equity markets since the terrorist attacks of september ==NUMBER====NUMBER== ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==1
data this year has confirmed trends that had looked worrying for months such as the fallout from the us housing slump and the crisis in the credit markets
equity markets' success in avoiding a sell-off for so long is more surprising than their recent and sudden capitulation
the lessons from history are not encouraging
however popular indicators of sentiment had already turned so bearish by the end of last week that they signalled an imminent bounce
but that has not happened
further the market's fascination with falls of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== and ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent can be misleading
since ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== when either index has fallen more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent from a high it has not staged a recovery until the sell-off has turned into a true bear market
once sell-offs go this far history says they can be expected to fall further before hitting a bottom
how is didi chuxing likely to spend the $==NUMBER==bn investment from apple
didi says it will be invested in products and new technology
but some experts say it will be needed to fuel its battle with us-based uber for market share in china
china's car-hailing wars have seen both sides spend billions of dollars funding discounts for customers and subsidies to drivers
in march didi's chairman cheng wei told the website qq tech that the company had set aside $==NUMBER==bn raised since last year to spend on what he called "market fostering"
it was not clear how much of it had already been spent though estimates based on a financial presentation made last year suggest didi could have lost $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn last year mainly on subsidies
uber lost $==NUMBER==bn last year in china according to chief executive travis kalanick
"didi cannot afford to lower subsidies or that will just be surrendering its users to competitors.
didi will not disclose its financial losses but a spokeswoman said it was spending less on subsidies than uber and was breaking even in more than half of the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== cities it operates in
"investors wouldn't have shown such support had we not shown them a clear path towards profitability" she said
apple has lost more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of its share of the chinese tablet market over the past year to cheaper rivals led by samsung electronics as devices based on google's android and other operating systems rapidly overtake the us company's gadgets
samsung shipped ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== or ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of the total in the second quarter of this year
the data echo statistics showing apple is losing ground in the tablet market worldwide
while ipad shipments globally dropped ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent year-on-year in the june quarter shipments in china continued to grow but not as fast as competitors' rising ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent compared with the same period last year idc said
that compared with triple-digit growth for other leading brands in the chinese market
android players are growing with strong price advantage" said idc analyst dickie chang "samsung lenovo asus and acer are providing more competitive products with [countrywide reach] meanwhile consumers are familiar with android os from smartphone use.
a principal factor in the rise of android tablets has been the falling price of components
that has enabled lower-cost chinese brands to make their presence felt in the tablet market
the average per-piece price of the touch panels used in ==NUMBER==-inch tablets fell ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent to $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year according to supply chain analysts at ihS
the funds will continue to hold us treasuries in the event of a downgrade or default but they are building up liquidity and shunning certain securities due to fears that a failure to raise the debt ceiling could trigger client redemptions
government-only money market funds have boosted the amount of cash available to meet redemptions within one week to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of assets from ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent at the end of march according to barclays capital
"we've built up liquidity with a rather meaningful amount of maturities prior to the debt ceiling" said robert brown head of fidelity's money market business
banks are also holding more cash and us corporations are postponing decisions due to uncertainty about where to invest cash amid fears that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would trigger a credit rating downgrade and possible default
money market funds are avoiding the one-month treasury notes which mature on august ==NUMBER== and august ==NUMBER==1
"those are the securities most vulnerable to some sort of change" said joseph abate strategist at barclays capital
the interest rates offered by the two one-month debt securities are more than twice the rate for lending the government money on a three-month note maturing in september
money market funds which hold $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn of us government debt according to citigroup are also reducing the amount of time they are willing to lend which could raise funding concerns for banks as they are reliant on short-term borrowing in the repurchase or repo market
a day after president barack obama urged lawmakers to come up with a "fair compromise" in the next few days there was no immediate sign of progress
democrats in the senate and republicans in the house of representatives are formulating separate plans to raise the national debt limit
shanghai is leading a race to host the headquarters of a new "brics" development bank that will challenge for the first time the us postwar dominance of multilateral lending institutions people familiar with the matter in bras lia and washington said
the bank to be controlled by brazil russia india china and south africa is expected to start with capital of $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn and to be officially launched by the brics heads of state at a summit in brazil on july ==NUMBER==5
the new bank which will be the first bricks-and-mortar institution to be set up by the brics economies will initially be too small to rival the world bank or the international monetary fund in terms of size and importance
but it will serve as a reminder to us policy makers of the need to reform these institutions to better reflect the shift in the global economy towards the developing world shanghai is leading a race to host the headquarters of a new "brics" development bank that will challenge for the first time the us postwar dominance of multilateral lending institutions people familiar with the matter in bras lia and washington said the bank to be controlled by brazil russia india china and south africa is expected to start with capital of $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn and to be officially launched by the brics heads of state at a summit in brazil on july ==NUMBER====NUMBER== "from this next summit the brics will be identified with a bank and with a contingent reserves arrangement which are in the process of being approved" said jos alfredo graa lima of brazil's external relations ministry
the establishment of the brics bank comes as china leads the charge for a separate multilateral institution in asia to rival the asian development bank which beijing fears is along with the world bank overly influenced by the us and its allies
last month it proposed doubling the size of registered capital for the bank which would be called the asian infrastructure investment bank to $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn compared with the adb's $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn the ft reported last week
under the plan four of the brics china russia india and south africa are suggesting cities to host the headquarters of the new institution
the issue is expected to be decided at the leaders' summit but shanghai is seen by analysts as the favourite
each of the brics will contribute an initial $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn to the new bank whose name has yet to be decided of which part will be paid in immediately and the rest will be callable capital available only if needed to meet the bank's obligations
the world bank had capital as of june last year of $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn most of it callable
membership by other countries will be considered at a later stage but the brics will remain in control of the majority of the shares
the leadership of the bank is likely to be rotated every five years with the first president of the institution to be decided by the heads of state in july

china's largest commercial bank grew rapidly in the middle east last year as trade links between the gulf and the world's second-largest economy flourished
lending deposits and profits at the middle east arm of the industrial and commercial bank of china all more than doubled in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== the bank announced yesterday amid booming demand for trade financing between the two regions
as chinese links to the middle east grew "we have been able to provide our clients with a trade and investment bridge" says tian zhiping chief executive of icbc's middle east business
the world's largest bank by market capitalisation launched its middle east unit in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== as the global financial crisis hit the gulf
despite subdued corporate activity and economic uncertainty in the region the unit's assets have grown ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-fold in the three years since reaching $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn by the end of last year a ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent rise over ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==0
lending grew at a similar clip with the balance of loans and advances up ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent to $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn
trade financing continues to represent the bulk of icbc's regional business but the bank's renminbi-denominated services are seeing growing demand as gulf states and their lenders looked to deepen their exposure to the chinese currency
"we see trade finance continuing to be one of the biggest growth areas for our business" says mr zhiping
but in expanding into other services he says "our rapidly growing renminbi business will enable us expand our investment banking and advisory businesses"
wall street executives in a private meeting with a top federal reserve official in late september recommended a coordinated effort by central banks to remedy the european financial crisis according to fed documents received in an open-records request the meeting led by louis bacon founder of hedge fund moore capital management preceded a joint action wednesday by the world's major central banks which banded together to provide liquidity to the markets through cheap us dollar loans
the sept ==NUMBER====NUMBER== meeting with mr dudley exemplifies the private meetings some wall street investors have with top fed officials in which they can gain access to potential early clues about fed actions
hedge funds have been pushing to get more information about the inner workings of the fed according to people familiar with the situation as detailed in a wall street journal page-one article nov ==NUMBER==3
the fed's meetings with investors present a delicate situation for us officials
the fed's mr dudley declined to comment
in a statement mr bacon defended the meetings saying the fed and treasury canvass market opinions extensively through a variety of private-sector committees contacts and trading desks in their task to fund the nation's exploding debt load stabilize markets and optimize economic outcomes
members of the investor advisory committee on financial markets include some of the biggest names on wall street including keith anderson of soros fund management mohamed el-erian of allianz se's pacific investment management co peter fisher of blackrock inc joshua harris of apollo management lp alan howard of brevan howard asset management deryck maughan a former chief executive of salomon brothers who now is at kohlberg kravis roberts & co and david tepper of appaloosa management lP
minutes of the meeting obtained by the wall street journal include notes taken by fed staff members but no record of comments by mr dudley or any fed officials at the meeting
mr dudley previously has said in a statement that he is in listening mode during the meetings and that he is careful not to provide insights into our thinking during meetings with investors
he also said it is important the fed understand investors' thinking during periods of stress and that he filters out investors' suggestions on policy that reflect their own interests
committee members have said the questions asked by the fed in advance of the meeting can give clues to the fed's thinking
the bulk of the three-hour meeting with mr dudley on sept ==NUMBER====NUMBER== at the new york fed headquarters addressed the fallout from the financial crisis in europe
mr bacon who was asked by fed staff members to lead the discussion began by saying he felt a greek default was likely and he believed there was a sizable risk of an accelerated greek bank run according to meeting minutes
the group suggested a number of ways to address the european crisis including coordinated credit easing and/or quantitative easing by the european central bank
the group also urged central bank guarantees of sovereign debt investments in european sovereigns and banks implementation of capital controls' and government guarantee of bank funding and/or depositors as well as recapitalization of the imf according to the minutes
a draft agenda in advance of the september meeting included questions about us fiscal and monetary policy as well as the crisis in europe according to the fed documents
following the call the agenda items relating to europe expanded according to the records
among the questions of the final agenda what steps should policy-makers consider to cushion any adverse market and economic impacts in europe and elsewhere of a credit event
mr bacon has been asked to speak about europe during meetings with the fed a number of times
i was wondering if you would consider leading off the discussion on europe as you did at a meeting last year the official said in the email
mr bacon responded the same day in an email saying ok i will take it on all europe all the time getting weary

lg is set to expand the number of its retail stores in emerging markets
still in china the world's largest smartphone market local players like huawei and zte have a competitive edge
we acknowledge [lg's] strong recovery in handsets but remain cautious on the sustainability of this  mr newman wrote in his report
the task he set his son was to sell off drg a uk stationery company whose brands included sellotape and basildon bond piece by piece

as a reward sir roland offered him an open credit line at a rate of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
however the process complicated by recession had been gruelling and controversial not to mention disappointing financially and mr franklin returned to america determined to invert the model his father and goldsmith had perfected
"breaking up a business is very anti- establishment it's the equivalent of short selling a stock today nobody is rooting for you i decided i wanted to build something instead.
in the ensuing years mr franklin now ==NUMBER====NUMBER== has gone a long way to delivering on this ambition following the sort of corporate trajectory he had been raised to disdain
jarden the consumer products company he has built up sells products as diverse as coffee grinders kitchen jars mops fire alarms babies' dummies tents fishing rods and candles
its most familiar wares include breville sandwich toasters rawlings baseball mitts and k==NUMBER== skis
the roots of jarden are in alltrista the maker of ball preserving jars
mr franklin took the helm of alltrista in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== having built and sold businesses in the eyewear and eyecare sector
he had initially amassed a ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent stake in alltrista before demanding board seats and being installed as chief executive
"i took an activist position or at least you'd call it that today but it was no different to what my father and jimmy were doing ==NUMBER====NUMBER== years before the difference was that i didn't want to buy the company and break it up.
mr franklin is far from being as much of a household name as some of jarden's brands however which appears to suit him given that he professes to dislike publicity partly because of negative press attention he received during the dismantling of drG
when we meet in a sleepy hotel on the new york-connecticut border it is without minders or entourage
he speaks economically his brands are not synergistically complementary verticals they are just "good"
some of his media profile thus far has been related to his running exploits not jogging but ultra-marathons that can stretch out for more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== miles
"endurance sports are a release they give me time to think" says mr franklin "some of my best ideas have been when i'm runningi also wanted to show my kids that daddy can suffer and that daddy doesn't always win and that life is tough.
it is also important he says that as the purveyor of a large number of sporting goods he does not come across as a "cigar-chomping chief exec"
discussion of exercise raises the inevitable question about his relationship with the disgraced cyclist lance armstrong
i ask him if he sees any reputational risk in associatin
with him "i think he's in an environment where a lot of people he competed with were shall we say on a level playing field and was still the most successful but i wasn't there so cannot.
at this moment his phone rings and the conversation stops
when he finishes he asks "where were we" i say he was saying something too diplomatic about mr armstrong
"yeah look i would never put myself in a position knowingly where i would ever have to apologise for my own conduct in business ever he did i wasn't there i can't judge
mr franklin has recently expanded his interests into speciality chemicals a shell company he launched ==NUMBER====NUMBER== months ago has closed or is closing a trio of deals worth $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn
but whether he is buying crop sprays or snowboard manufacturers the deals are guided by the same basic idea that a good brand can stand alone in the wider company irrespective of what else that company sells
it is a philosophy that runs counter to the current mode for streamlining businesses epitomised by procter & gamble's recently announced plans to cull up to ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== of its consumer brands
"i think [p&g's] challenge is they're trying to do the soupe du jour for wall street not always a good strategy there is an obsession with streamlining businesses at the moment which basically means lay-offs
in the store a female shopper scans mr franklin for a few seconds before approaching

eurozone bond markets suffered a mass sell-off on tuesday as investor fears spread beyond italy and spain to triple a rated france austria finland and the netherlands
the premium that france and austria pay over germany to borrow rose to euro-era records of ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== basis points and ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bp respectively levels investors say are no longer consistent with top credit ratings
"markets are losing patience so they are going for the jugular which is the core countries and not the periphery" said neil williams chief economist at hermes the uk fund manager "there is convergence but it is convergence on the weakest.
mike riddell of m&g one of europe's biggest fund managers called it "probably the most worrying day" of the crisis so far

in warehousing's heyday the firms offered aluminum producers cash rent discounts and other incentives to put metal into storage rather than selling to users such as brewers and soft-drink makers according to analysts and traders
meanwhile the prolonged time in inventory generated hefty rental income for warehouse owners that more than made up for the incentives paid out
industrial aluminum users such as coca-cola co and aluminum-sheet maker novelis inc have complained to the london metal exchange that warehouses had artificially slowed the release of aluminum limiting supply and driving up prices
a millercoors llc executive testified in a senate banking committee hearing last month that the practices were inflating consumer prices by billions of dollars
glencore goldman sachs and jp morgan declined to comment
average daily aluminum shipments to lme warehouses were down ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% in the first ==NUMBER====NUMBER== days of august from two months earlier according to data provided by new york-based metals consulting firm cpm group inc august's daily average rate of aluminum deliveries is the lowest since november ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== cpm group said

not for the first time this year the behaviour of the chinese renminbi is causing more than the odd furrowed brow in the market
"if this continued [this will] undermine the people's bank's case that the currency is being kept basically stable'" says mark williams chief asia economist at capital economics who says the chinese authorities have "mismanaged" the renminbi since first announcing the basket in december
"december's oblique statement that they were managing [the renminbi] against the basket was one of the triggers of the [global market] panic so they responded by locking down volatility against the dollar the opposite to what the statement had suggested" mr williams says
he believes the people's bank has taken advantage of a period of broad dollar weakness to let the renminbi slide a move that has gone little noticed with most attention still focused on the bilateral rate against the dollar
robert minikin head of asia fx strategy at standard chartered believes at least part of the weakening of the renminbi on a trade-weighted basis is "tactical" given that the dollar might be expected to strengthen anew if and when the us federal reserve starts raising interest rates again
mr minikin's view stems from his perception that china is in reality steering a "middle path" between maintaining a stable trade-weighted rate and a stable rate against the dollar
"when you get big moves in the dollar's value they are reflecting that in some way in the [renminbi's] fix but not in a way to completely prevent it feeding through into [the trade-weighted] value" he says
"i think it's still in transition the idea that they have jumped directly to manage against the basket hasn't been borne out by these moves" says mr minikin who believes this period of transition could last for several years given the wider world's continuing obsession with the bilateral dollar rate
in reality the chinese authorities have always said that while they want the renminbi to be broadly stable against the basket this does not entail a hard and fast peg
instead movements are supposed to reflect "the dynamic of market supply and demand" in the "real economy" 
"don't think they are going to micromanage [the renminbi's rate] they will keep us guessing a bit and that's what you have to do in financial markets" mr bloom says
the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==-mark is the level the renminbi closed at on december ==NUMBER====NUMBER== ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== when the international monetary fund thought it was about fair value in trade-weighted terms
however given the uncertainty the renminbi's ructions cause for markets worldwide he argues there is merit in beijing adopting a more explicit fx regime to avoid any misunderstandings
known primarily for its e-commerce heft in china alibaba is redesigning its business for the mobile internet era by stepping up investment in its own smartphone operating system
its $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million investment in sina corps twitter-like weibo microblog business on monday followed an earlier move this month to promote its mobile platform
a tighter grip over sina weibo which has ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million daily active users could enable alibaba whose taobao shopping site has more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million registered users to have access to vast swaths of data
and having control over the operating system is the best way to gain access to all the mobile-based data mr zeng said
data on mobile phones are so valuable he said
while alibaba makes money through advertisement and service fees how to monetize data accumulated through its online services--be it on pcs or mobile--has been a challenge
the fledgling alibaba mobile os or amos faces an uphill battle against android which according to research firm idc powered more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of all smartphones shipped in china last year
apple's ios held around ==NUMBER====NUMBER==%
alibaba is aiming for a ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% share even though its current market share is less than ==NUMBER==% mr zeng said
in september google objected to acer incs plan to sell a smartphone powered by alibaba's oS
as acer is part of the google-led open handset alliance the us firm said that the taiwanese computer maker couldn't work with a noncompatible version of android
alibaba rejected the view that its os was an android fork but the acer phone was never released
if quite a few handset companies decide to choose alibaba's os google will have to be careful in how far they want to push it even if the handset makers belong to the open handset alliance said mr zeng
google declined to comment
alibaba founded in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== initially became known for its alibabacom business-to-business site connecting chinese suppliers with buyers but it has since expanded with websites for consumers
taobao is an ebay-like marketplace for small merchants while tmall hosts online storefronts for retailers including brands such as gap inc 
weibo could bring a boost to alibaba's mobile-based businesses said canalys analyst rachel lashford
the deeper the cooperation the bigger the benefits
one factor that could work in alibaba's favor in china google faces challenges due to beijing's restrictions despite growth in some of its online advertising services
the company has pulled out its search service out of mainland china disagreements over censorship
in march a chinese government research institute accused google of using android's dominance to discriminate against local companies
google declined to comment on the accusation
given the restrictions on android's services in china alibaba could make its os more competitive by seamlessly integrating weibo's service and also taking advantage of its alipay affiliate's expertise in mobile payment said ms lashford
you have to compete differently in the mobile space rather than simply leveraging your strength in the pc-based market mr zeng said
fears that speculative inflows of "hot money" could destabilise the chinese economy have long pre-occupied policymakers in beijing
now that the renminbi has been cut loose from its peg to the us dollar these worries are back with a vengeance
the problem for policymakers is that most investors believe that the renminbi is significantly undervalued against the dollar some even estimate by almost as much as ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
so speculating on a revaluation is widely seen as a one-way bet
speculative inflows surged during this period as investors bet on further renminbi appreciation
this saw china's currency reserves rise by $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn as it stemmed the renminbi's rise compared with an increase of just $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn in the previous three years when the currency was pegged to the dollar
"currency reserves shot up compounding china's problem of how to diversify its assets they will want to avoid that problem this time.
the message speculators could get burned
"the pboc is trying to make the point that there is two-way risk this is not just a one-way bet" said robert reilly co-head of asian fixed income and currencies at soci t g n rale
while the renminbi was allowed to rise ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent against the dollar on monday the biggest move in ==NUMBER====NUMBER== months traders got a shock yesterday when it retreated ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
the talk in the market was that chinese state-owned banks were aggressively driving down the price of the renminbi under orders from the central bank
"the greater flexibility or two-way volatility between the renminbi and the dollar will help mitigate hot money inflows" said jun ma china economist at deutsche bank
mr ma expects that there will be greater volatility in the exchange rate than there was between mid-==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== and july ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== when the renminbi rose more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent against the dollar
meanwhile behind the scenes chinese policymakers have been telling domestic banks that they must be on their guard to prevent clients from sending money in and out of the country to fund illicit speculation
two weeks ago china's state administration of foreign exchange  which manages the country's $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn in foreign exchange reserves summoned senior bankers to discuss the renminbi forwards market
but the regulator stopped short of introducing controls on renminbi forward transactions unlike south korea which imposed restrictions on forwards transactions this month to reduce volatility in the won
but economists reckon the chances of a big move are slim
the consensus expects a shallow gradual appreciation
three-month non-deliverable forwards currently imply a rise of just ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent in the renminbi against the dollar while one-year forwards suggest the market is expecting a rise of just ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
in the past rising expectations for renminbi appreciation in the forwards market have tended to coincide with hot money inflows
one reason given is that the annualised rate of appreciation is too slim to attract those investors who are unable to take on leverage
another big disincentive for hot money is that there are widespread fears that the chinese economy is starting to cool and that the property market is about to crash
"hot money inflows are not driven just by currency appreciation expectations but also by expectations on asset prices" said qu hongbin hsbc's head of asian economics research
the shanghai stock market has already tumbled more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent this year while housing sales are dropping sharply in many cities following a government clampdown on property speculation
in some respects an increase in hot money inflows into china would provide a welcome boost to domestic liquidity reckons michael kurtz china strategist at macquarie
"it may perversely help stabilise or even lift china's sagging domestic real estate and equity markets" mr kurtz said
that would trigger severe outflows economists say
and while inflows are relatively easy to manage through conventional policy tools such as open market operations or changes to the reserve requirement ratio sudden outflows would be more problematic mr kurtz said
carlyle group lp's flagship local-currency fund in china set up with the beijing city government is close to finalizing its first investment said carlyle co-founder david rubenstein who remains bullish on china despite two investments that recently have soured
it's hard to know what additional steps might have been taken but obviously something could have been done better said mr rubenstein when asked about china agritech inc and china forestry holdings co two companies in which carlyle has invested and which recently had serious questions raised about their accounting
the former chief executive of hong kong-listed china forestry was arrested by chinese authorities in february on allegations he embezzled ==NUMBER====NUMBER== million yuan
meanwhile the nasdaq stock market has moved to delist china agritech after the company dumped ernst & young hua ming as its auditor when the chinese branch of the us audit firm balked at signing off on the company's books
agritech has appealed the nasdaq's delisting move and its shares have been suspended when you're in the private-equity investing world everything doesn't work every time mr rubenstein said
a number of chinese firms that are listed in the us singapore and hong kong have drawn allegations from investors and regulators in recent months that they have distorted their earnings and the true nature of their operations
that has raised questions about the quality of corporate governance in china and the extent to which investors are properly informed about the firms in which they have invested
with $==NUMBER== billion invested by carlyle in about ==NUMBER====NUMBER== chinese firms mr rubenstein played down the significance of the problems at the two firms
our experience in china couldn't be better he said
mr rubenstein said carlyle has recently opened an office in the western city of chengdu to better access opportunities away from the traditional private-equity stomping grounds along china's coastal regions
mr rubenstein said the joint-venture fund carlyle set up with the beijing city government one of two yuan-denominated funds carlyle set up last year has reached an agreement on its first deal
he said the company is in the retail sector but declined say more
its other fund a shanghai-based joint venture with chinese conglomerate fosun group is looking at deals' but hasn't made any investments yet he said
traditionally foreign private-equity funds have invested in china with money raised from overseas
but increasingly they are looking inward where there is no shortage of domestic investors looking for alternatives to the stock and property markets to put their money
moreover funds denominated in yuan have a broader range of local investment opportunities than their foreign-currency counterparts
foreign funds have recently been setting up their own yuan funds
us-based tpg launched funds of five billion yuan each in shanghai and chongqing last year
carlyle's beijing fund has already raised $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million worth of yuan from local chinese investors including beijing-based pension funds
the fund hopes to raise upward of $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million in total
the fact that we could raise as much as we've raised for our [yuan] fund is really testament to the fact that beijing is our partner mr rubenstein said if beijing had not been our partner we couldn't have raised the amount of money we've raised today
carlyle acquired its china forestry stake in two transactions beginning in january ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== paying us$==NUMBER====NUMBER== million for what now amounts to nearly ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of the company
according to preliminary figures from harvard's admissions department about ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== students in the class of ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== are from finance industries -- including private equity banking and venture capital -- compared with ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% last year
harvard administrators say the change reflects a greater quantity of strong applicants from nonfinance industries
students with manufacturing backgrounds make up ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of the class of ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== up from ==NUMBER==% the previous year
technology rose three percentage points to ==NUMBER==%
though the school continually seeks to bring in a diverse mix of students we don't run with quotas or targets says deirdre leopold managing director of mba admissions and financial aid we drive towards what they can contribute to the overall learning
but some mba admissions consultants say they've seen finance-industry clients rejected who would have been admitted in other years
when they sought reasons from harvard they were told it was because their backgrounds were in finance or consulting rather manufacturing or technology he says
some applicants to harvard likely will try to adjust their applications to fit what they see as harvard's desires says jeremy shinewald founder of mbamission inc an admissions consulting firm
you're going to see guys who worked on one private-equity deal with an auto manufacturer try to play up their auto experience and look ridiculous he says
about ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of harvard's class of ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== will be female its highest percentage ever ms leopold says
wen jiabao china's premier has given his most optimistic assessment of the chinese economy since the start of the year saying that it had stabilised and that the government's target of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent annual growth was well within reach
mr wen's comments published in a statement on the government's main website on wednesday came a day before china publishes its third-quarter gdp data
the data are widely expected to show growth slowing from the ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent recorded in the second quarter and marking the country's seventh straight quarterly slowdown
before previous data releases this year mr wen warned that the chinese economy faced "downward pressure" because of the lingering impact of the global financial crisis
but in the comments released on wednesday he struck a more upbeat tone "the economy in the third quarter was quite good we can now say with confidence that the growth of the chinese economy is basically stabilising  as policies are implemented and hit their mark the chinese economy will stabilise further.
he added that he was sure the economy would achieve the government's full-year target of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent growth
analysts from investment banks to the world bank have downgraded their forecasts for chinese growth in recent months though most still see it clearing the ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent mark
china will begin a once-in-a-decade leadership transition in november leaving mr wen with a little less than five months left in his premiership
he has faced sharp criticism domestically for failing to move the economy away from its reliance on investment bequeathing an unbalanced growth model to his successors that analysts warn could result in a crisis
but in the comments released on wednesday mr wen defended his record "we have taken new steps towards structural transformation" he said
he singled out the steel sector and called for stronger efforts to eliminate overcapacity
mr wen had made his remarks during a series of meetings with officials industry executives and economists between october ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-==NUMBER==5
the government has been working to cool the property market blocking people from buying second homes and mr wen vowed that these policies would continue
reviewing the economy's performance in the third quarter mr wen said that there had been a series of positive developments particularly since the start of september
chinese exports rose ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent year-on-year in september while inflation dipped to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent well down from last year's peak of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
the government has steadfastly refused to launch a large stimulus programme like it did in late ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== but it has unveiled a series of smaller investment plans and also loosened the reins on bank lending

"economic activity could be on a recovery path going into the fourth quarter on improved financing and increased infrastructure investment" ha jiming a strategist with goldman sachs wrote in a note
goldman sachs group inc sent waves of erroneous orders into the stock-options market on tuesday morning the latest technical glitch to roil market prices and bedevil traders and regulators
the orders placed for options on stocks and exchange-traded funds with ticker symbols beginning with the letters i through k drove some prices sharply lower
us options exchanges notified traders on tuesday that officials were reviewing the trades and might cancel some
still goldman's potential losses on the mishap could run into hundreds of millions of dollars according to people familiar with the matter
the exchanges are working to resolve the issue a goldman spokesman said in a statement neither the risk nor the potential loss is material to the financial condition of the firm
the trading error highlights the mounting risks of global financial markets that increasingly are being driven by computers rather than people
a series of mishaps since the flash crash of ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== which sent stocks and exchange-traded funds plummeting in minutes have undermined confidence in market systems around the world
the system mistakenly issued orders based on that data but at a default price that in some cases was far below market rates
goldman fixed the issue and is studying what went wrong one person said
people familiar with the matter said goldman's total losses could range from several million dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars depending on how many trades the exchanges allow to stand
firms also can reach deals with counterparties on errant trades that reduce their potential losses
in its notice nyse officials said they anticipate that most of the impacted trades will be busted or canceled
the episode is the latest in a series of market mishaps arising from technology designed to make markets more efficient the cboe suffered a system outage on april ==NUMBER====NUMBER== that forced it to delay the open of trading for more than three hours

the us senate voted tuesday to pass legislation targeting china's management of its currency the yuan underscoring us frustration with one of its largest trading partners
although the bill is unlikely to become law the senate debate has kept a public focus on the currency issue as the two countries remain at odds over china's control of the yuan
in recent days the chinese central bank has intervened in currency markets to drive up the value of the yuan against the dollar a development in line with us goals
a bipartisan group of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== lawmakers voted in favor of legislation intended to force the white house to be more aggressive in seeking tariffs and other penalties against countries with misaligned currencies while ==NUMBER====NUMBER== lawmakers opposed it
the bill is aimed at helping us firms which argue that beijing's policy of holding down the value of the yuan benefits china's exporters by acting as a trade subsidy
majority leader john boehner has called the approach dangerous and has insisted he will resist pressure for a house vote
that may be the best outcome for the obama administration
white house officials have opposed action by congress in the past while trying to leverage the threat of congressional action to press china for a faster rate of currency appreciation
president barack obama weighed in on the issue last week when he accused china of manipulating the yuan and gaming the trading system to its advantage
but he also expressed concern about how the senate bill might affect us international obligations
chinese officials have objected to the senate effort
but china supporters say it is unlikely that beijing will take concrete action against the us unless the bill is enacted
chinese officials have reached a consensus that ==NUMBER==% or so in annual yuan appreciation is enough to help fight domestic inflation and eventually lift the currency to a point where it could float freely
mr obama and treasury secretary timothy geithner have said that pace isn't adequate
but given the expected change in leadership in beijing next year us officials acknowledge privately that politicians are unlikely to make a substantial change to the speed
the senate's vote on the bill highlights the role china could play in the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== elections
some lawmakers have seized on the country as a reason the us has a faltering economic recovery a central point in current political debate
business organizations such as the business roundtable and us chamber of commerce say the bill could spur trade disputes that would hurt us interests
sen joe lieberman said tuesday he worried about the countries engaging in a mutually damaging trade war
the latest data from the government were mildly encouraging retail sales increased ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% in august from the prior month after increasing ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% in july the commerce department said tuesday in a sign that consumer spending is growing at a sustainable clip
weak consumer spending and stubbornly high unemployment have hobbled the recovery and prompted fears in some quarters that the us could slip back toward recession
but those fears have eased recently as the us has notched several better-than-expected economic reports
the central bank is considering whether to restart the bond-buying it undertook last year and early this year to drive-down long-term interest rates and encourage more private borrowing and thus economic growth
it has already pushed short-term interest rates to near zero but growth remains stubbornly slow unemployment high and inflation lower than the fed wants
right now the fed is holding its bond portfolio at a constant level
fed chairman ben bernanke has avoided laying out specifically what would prompt him to grow that portfolio by restarting the bond-buying program
other members of the policy-setting federal open market committee have differing views
tuesday's retail sales numbers suggested the consumer sector is holding up though not growing briskly
thanks in part to back-to-school shopping consumers doled out more money at clothing stores where sales climbed ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% in august
but shoppers have been made hesitant by high unemployment and falling home prices
this hit big-ticket items in august
sales at auto dealers furniture stores and electronic and appliance retailers fell
mr bernanke has laid out broad markers for his threshold to further fed action but has been vague to avoid getting ahead of the brewing debate the fed would be proactive in addressing significant further disinflation he said in an august speech suggesting the threat of an inflation slowdown could spur him to act
he added the fed wanted to avoid a further significant weakening in the economic outlook suggesting more subpar growth could be another trigger
global banks can no longer assume access to the federal reserve's discount lending window as an element of their living wills people familiar with the process have warned
hundreds of banks took advantage of the discount lending window on many occasions during the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== crisis
they added that the prohibition defeats the purpose of the discount window and the fed's role as the lender of last resort
"how are you supposed to write these living wills if the assumptions regulators are making are false and inaccurate" asked one us analyst "they are disconnected from what would happen in the real world.
but the fed and the federal deposit insurance corporation which are under pressure to avoid government bailouts in any future crisis want the banks to come up with emergency plans that do not involve government aid even when it comes to the discount window which is available only to banks that are in trouble rather than failing
for the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== living wills ==NUMBER====NUMBER== banks ranging from citigroup to barclays were told they had made unrealistic assumptions about how customers counterparties and investors would behave in a crisis
in addition they were informed that they had failed to identify the kinds of structural change that would be needed to ensure an orderly resolution
officials have said the living wills are a learning process and more leeway was given to banks for the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== process
having already submitted living wills for this year before receiving the response to their ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== plans banks have to show improvements in their ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== plans or risk facing financial penalties
the fed and the fdic were split on their responses to the living wills this month
the fdic took the more severe stance of deeming the plans "not credible" which paves the way for potentially punitive action
the fed stopped short of that saying instead that the banks had to immediately rectify "shortcomings"
misaligned exchange rates are more often than not a prelude to trade friction
buy america provisions and bail-outs for bankrupt motor companies are less damag- ing than trade barriers of the kind erected by the smoot-hawley act in the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s
until august ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== liberalisation in global banking enhanced the efficiency of the financial system and facilitated trade in goods and services along with cross-border movements of capital
the huge advantage of such globalisation was that lenders no longer needed to be physically close to borrowers
the impact has been quite as severe as any controls over imports although a return of financial stability would mitigate the damage
capital and financial flows tend to display a homing instinct in a crisis
and this is now being reinforced by the regulatory response to the financial debacle
home countries iceland being the most obvious case in point may not be able to honour obligations to depositors abroad if their banks are too big for their economies
there are plenty of countries that potentially fall into this category
new york-based econo- mist geoffrey bell points out for example that ireland's bank liabilities are ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of gdp while switzerland's are ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent which has led to suggestions that ubs and credit suisse should be forced to shrink
by threatening to curtail cross- border capital movements such regulation will shrink trade in goods and services and thus moderate growth and development
reducing institutions' international reach will says the bis come at the expense of economies of scale and scope
so a safer and more stable financial system may be a less efficient one
excess savings in asia northern europe and the petro-economies are deflationary
in response to the global recession the excess savers have loosened fiscal policy
but in germany's case this has been done with extreme reluctance
japan has been more willing but its public sector debt burden is such that it will probably want to tighten relatively soon
the counterpart of a surplus of savings over investment is a current account surplus
it follows that the excess savers continue to expect others and the us in particular to provide a dumping ground for their exports
but why should the us do this at the cost of another debt binge and subsequent crash
why americans will ask should they burden their children with huge debts just to generate jobs in germany japan and china
the only positive gloss that can be put on this is that it may take a dose of protectionism to shock the excess savers into structural change
but that smacks of burning down the house to roast the pig
sampling foreign foods is a highlight of many tourist itineraries but a particular group of rich indians take a different approach to eating overseas they bring along their own chefs
the marwari people from the desert state of rajasthan are strict vegetarians known in india for their adherence to traditional hindu customs and for their wealth -- often from trading
their chefs are known as maharaj or little kings because of their importance in the marwari household and marwaris are also gaining renown in india and elsewhere for taking these chefs with them wherever they go
in one notable example last month mumbai-based billionaire rakesh jhunjhunwala who made his fortune trading on the stock market flew out to mauritius his eight chefs to cater for his ==NUMBER====NUMBER==th birthday celebration
the chefs cordoned off a section of the intercontinental mauritius kitchen to prepare the vegetable dishes dals or lentils masala tea and sweets
they even brought their own spices said the hotel's manager raju gandi no one is more particular about eating their own food than the indians and the chinese
a growing number of indians are holidaying abroad -- ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million of them vacationed overseas last year up almost ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% from the previous year according to the world travel and tourism council
it's not uncommon for them to prefer to eat home-cooked food when overseas packing away a paratha or flat bread and pickles or even their own stove on which to cook lentils and rice while traveling
we are pretty orthodox when it comes to food said gayatri ruia a real-estate executive from mumbai our food is a way of life and we are creatures of habit when cost is no consideration it makes sense to take your own cook so you can be sure of enjoying the food you love
marwaris will not eat food that has been prepared in kitchens where meat poultry fish or eggs have also been present
they cook food that is fiery and distinctive and features lots of dried vegetables beans and hard desert berries with buttermilk used instead of water
many wealthy marwaris guard their maharaj closely and chefs often pass on their skills to their own children so that several generations of maharaj can end up working for generations of the same marwari family
many indians including marwaris are also taking their chefs with them when they go overseas to celebrate special family occasions such as weddings anniversaries and birthdays -- a trend that has accelerated in recent years
mahesh prasad a ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-year-old maharaj has worked for new delhi home-furnishings exporter puja jain for ==NUMBER====NUMBER== years
his father was chef for the jains for ==NUMBER====NUMBER== years before retiring
ms jain and her parents manju and dharam prakash kothari always take their cooks and foodstuffs with them because they don't trust the provenance of any food except what is made in their home
that means traveling not just with the chef but also the dry ingredients spices and even the cooking oil
when ms jain and ==NUMBER====NUMBER== of her family rang in the new year in dubai this year mr prasad and his two junior chefs were there to cook dinner or traditional marwari thali -- a mix of lentil and vegetable dishes plus rice chapattis pickles yoghurt chutneys salad and poppadum
you'll never see a marwari traveling without spices pickles and the savoury snacks that we must have at tea time said ms jain it's basically about comfort everything about a holiday is new -- the place culture and language -- so it's nice to have the comfort of familiar food
china's foreign exchange regulator has uncovered $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn in fake cross-border trade since april last year and has turned ==NUMBER====NUMBER== cases over to police in a crackdown aimed at curbing hot money flows
speculators have long used inflated trade invoices as a means to skirt china's strict capital controls and convert foreign currency into renminbi aiming to profit from currency appreciation and higher interest rates
china's currency is freely convertible for foreign trade and other current account transactions but there are tight restrictions on investment flows
for the past decade speculators aiming to circumvent these capital controls have overstated the value of export invoices allowing them to disguise speculative capital as income from the sale of goods and services
banks that buy and sell foreign exchange to clients are supposed to verify the authenticity of trade documents but enforcement is often lax
speculators typically use hard-to-value items such as electronic circuits as the basis for their invoices making it tricky to detect inflated shipment values
"many firms used forged or altered trade documents or reused property documents to conduct fake trade" wu ruilin deputy head of safe's inspection department said at a press conference in beijing according to a transcript
"they used re-exporting as a tool for speculation and arbitrage even turning it into a channel for cross-border flows of hot money and criminal funds" mr wu said referring to the practice of exporting a shipment of goods and then reimporting it often through a neighbouring port
the difference between the reported value of the two shipments constitutes an illicit fund flow
safe has periodically cracked down on hot money flows over the past decade when hot money inflows have threatened to disrupt the central bank's efforts to control the money supply and contain property or other asset bubbles
investors' appetite to bring hot money into china appears to have waned this year however as economic growth has slowed and renminbi appreciation appears less of a sure bet than in the past
safe said it was increasing its use of "data analysis" through its electronic forex monitoring to uncover cases of apparent fraud
anyone with an equity fund that tracks the s&p ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== has something close to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of their investment in commodities companies such as oil and gas producers or the miners of metals and minerals
for anyone who owns the ftse ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== the figure is more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent largely because bp and shell dominate the uk stock market
yet an increasing number of financial advisers suggest that investors should also carve out an additional piece of their portfolio to invest directly in commodities
the advice is controversial but for many people who are considering moving beyond a "plain vanilla" portfolio of stocks and bonds commodities will be an obvious option to consider
the list of tradeable commodities literally runs from a to z from aluminium to zinc
crude oil and natural gas are among the most important to the global economy but energy investors can also pick propane or ethanol or heating oil
agricultural staples include corn and coffee and cocoa among many more
and there are a good half-dozen industrial metals to trade and precious ones too including the speculator's favourite gold
just about the only characteristic in common across this diverse list is volatility
commodities do not pay dividends or generate earnings like company shares and they do not promise to pay interest like a bond
without these anchors their price swings wildly in response to changing assumptions about supply and demand
political developments are far from the only things an investor has to monitor
changing global trade patterns currency fluctuations recessions wars even the weather whose occasional droughts and deluges can ruin an entire year's agricultural crop any of these could send prices soaring or crashing
counterintuitively despite all that volatility adding commodities to a portfolio may help an investor sleep at night
that at least is the theory espoused by financial advisers who recommend a ==NUMBER== or ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent allocation to the asset class
the traditional way for individuals to invest was to set up a brokerage account and to venture into the futures markets
this is still the spiciest way to trade today the leverage built into these derivatives contracts means that one can make big money from relatively small changes in a commodity's price but brokers can also demand large sums of money to cover potential losses and bad bets can go very sour very quickly
the etfcom database shows ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== such funds in the us alone ranging from single-commodity funds like the spdr gold etf to the popular powershares db commodity index tracking fund which mimics the price movement of a broad basket of commodities
be wary of some pitfalls however
actively managed mutual funds are a popular alternative and pimco and fidelity are among the industry titans with commodities offerings
investors will find that professionally managed diversified funds inevitably come with higher fees
such is humankind's historic attachment to gold its fans argue it can be counted on to retain its value even while currencies decline and empires fall
certainly it remains a go-to investment in a financial crisis and investors who see inflation around the corner will always consider gold a hedge against the declining real value of other assets
the two largest commodities etfs are both gold funds and no other investment arouses such passionate debate but the precious metal's price remains as slippery as any other commodity
gold indeed like all commodities belongs in the category of speculative trades rather than long-term investments
big ben went small
and that is probably a good thing
rather than come in guns blazing in the wake of monday's market rout the federal reserve chose at its tuesday meeting to hold off on extreme measures notably the resumption of purchases of government bonds that some investors had hoped for
instead chairman ben bernanke and the fed opted only to change language for how long it expects to keep interest rates near zero until at least mid-==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==' previously the fed only said rates would be kept low for an extended period
as unprecedented as this was it still fell short of what some in markets expected
not that it immediately mattered -- stocks soared
this is especially the case given three fed members dissented from the statement because they thought the extended period language shouldn't have been changed
moving too fast also holds other risks
a quick reversal on asset purchases would have looked schizophrenic given that just two months ago it opted to let its previous $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion bond-buying program expire as planned
it also isn't clear how much impact additional bond buying would have on the economy and job growth
even if the last bond-buying program helped -- an issue still the subject of much debate -- the fed risks getting less and less bang for its buck
plus banks aren't in the kind of dire straits that necessitate central-bank action
the financial system is awash in liquidity and credit markets are functioning
perhaps the biggest reason for the fed to hold back by not riding to the markets' rescue it may put more pressure on politicians in washington
just as markets have become overly reliant on the fed washington also has become too confident that even if it dithers bernanke & co will do the heavy lifting
after all as mr bernanke has repeatedly said the fed can only do so much
true the fed isn't likely to stand by if deflation again becomes a threat
but for now the fed is right to let markets find their own footing and demand the government does its part to shore up the economy
at a dramatic press conference relayed live on television he proclaimed victory in his tussle with general electric titan of us industrial capitalism over the terms of its takeover of much of the energy group alstom symbol of french engineering prowess
"it is a victory for alstom a success for france and undeniably a political success for the return in force of the state in the economy" mr montebourg said
for him the key condition of the deal was for the state to become alstom's biggest shareholder acquiring a ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent stake
that will make the french government ge's main partner in the three areas where ge and alstom will have ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== joint ventures in power grid operations renewables and nuclear turbines with the state holding an additional "golden share" in the latter
but for mr montebourg and the government an important and longstanding principle of french industrial policy has been upheld the central role of the state
there were differences within the government over the alstom case
until the last mr montebourg's preference was for a rival bid he solicited from siemens
the german group which ultimately joined forces with japan's mitsubishi heavy industries to propose a deal similar in structure to that eventually struck with gE
mr hollande was careful to remain neutral his team clearly mindful of ge's long record as a good corporate citizen in france
but there were no arguments over the necessity to step in when news of alstom's original plan to make a clean sale of its energy business to ge leaked in april "it was perfectly natural for the government to intervene" said a senior presidential aide citing the strategic nature of alstom's operations particularly in nuclear power "such a deal would have been impossible for a french company in the us" he added
the stage is set for a showdown friday morning over control of a lower manhattan park as occupy wall street protesters vowed to resist efforts by the city and the site's landlord to remove them to clean the area
protesters issued calls on twitter for supporters to begin arriving at midnight to zuccotti park to marshal a resistance setting up a possible confrontation with the landlord brookfield office properties inc and new york city police in front of a huge media audience
some said they would link arms and refuse to leave as the cleaning crews arrived at ==NUMBER== am
brookfield and the city say the privately owned park has become unsanitary after nearly four weeks of occupation by hundreds of anti-corporate protesters
mr kelly said the demonstrators would be allowed to return after the cleaning but can't bring beds tarps and other prohibited items terms the protesters said would effectively end their occupation
we won't allow [mayor michael] bloomberg and the nypd to foreclose our occupation said occupy wall street spokesman patrick bruner in a statement this is an occupation not a permitted picnic
friday morning's interaction with the demonstrators poses thorny issues for brookfield and the police
the landlord has repeatedly asked the nypd to intervene but mr kelly said thursday the park's regulations must be enforced by brookfield
this is private property he said any control of that property in terms of directing people to adhere to the regulations that they put in place will be done by brookfield personnel
eugene o'donnell a professor of law and police studies at john jay college of criminal justice said the stakes for all sides were high
you could have a ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-year-old grandmother there who could end up dead before that's all over through nobody's fault just because you've got hundreds of people on one side and hundreds of people on the other side said mr o'donnell though he doubted the confrontation would happen because there was too much risk for all involve
if the protesters are seen as being violent or provocative or disregard public safety and public order i think they could end up with a serious problem mr o'donnell said
the european central bank responded thursday to pressure for radical action to stop the rot in the euro zone's financial markets but stopped well short of giving any commitment to increased purchases of government bonds
ecb spelled out a raft of measures to help ease pressure on banks but none to bail out its debt-laden governments with ecb president mario draghi repeating earlier messages that the bank's program of government debt purchases is neither infinite nor eternal
mr draghi was also decidedly cool on the prospect of lending money to the international monetary fund in order to let it lend back to troubled euro-zone governments although he didn't categorically rule out the possibility that national central banks in the eu rather than the ecb itself could supply the funds
euro-zone officials on thursday said the eu is nearing a deal to lend ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion to the imf including ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion from the ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-nation currency bloc that the imf could then use to shore up the troubled euro-zone sovereign-debt market
eu leaders were to make final decisions on the proposal at their summit meeting starting thursday as part of a larger deal they hope will prevent a collapse of the euro zone
the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion will come from bilateral loans from the euro zone's central banks to the imf while an additional ==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion in loans would come from noneuro-zone eu countries an eu diplomat said
bond purchases and imf-enhanced support had been talked up as having potentially the biggest impact in restoring confidence to battered markets and financial markets reacted with acute disappointment
italian ==NUMBER====NUMBER==-year bond yields having fallen as low as ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==% shot back up to ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==% in later trading
the euro meanwhile fell nearly two cents against the dollar during mr draghi's news conference to $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== close to its intraday low
mr draghi said he was puzzled by the reaction to his comments
we have our own views we have collaborated in the process but the responsibility is with the leaders he said
mr draghi announced the new measures after the bank decided to cut its benchmark rate as expected by a quarter point returning it to a record low of ==NUMBER==%
the bank now expects inflation to average around ==NUMBER==% next year and ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== and has lowered its growth forecasts
a decade ago when alan greenspan was chairman of the mighty federal reserve he was infamous for delivering ambiguous delphic speeches that nobody could understand
no longer
these days the retired greenspan speaks so clearly that some of his words are still ricocheting around the blogosphere
for what he revealed on the cfr platform was that he harbours considerable doubts about whether recent western monetary policy experiments have actually helped economic growth
he also fears that such experiments have been so wild that it will be very hard to exit from these policies in the future in the us or anywhere else without sparking huge market volatility
indeed greenspan is so worried about future turbulence that he apparently sympathises with investors who are currently stocking up on gold
"why do central banks put money into an asset which has no rate of return but [has] cost of storage and insurance and everything else like that why are they doing that" he asked rhetorically before offering his own explanation "gold is a currency it is still by all evidence a premier currency
now by many standards this is a remarkable comment
in his youth greenspan was fascinated by gold 
so it is striking if not counter-intuitive that he now considers gold a viable currency let alone an attractive investment bet
this is a bit like a turkey giving a treatise on the value of christmas
unsurprisingly greenspan's comments have sparked considerable scorn from some of his former and current colleagues in the western central bank world
but though greenspan's comments might make other central bankers wince it would be foolish to ignore them
take a look for example at switzerland
but recent polls indicate almost half the population supports the idea suggesting it could possibly be passed
meanwhile on the other side of the atlantic the recent midterm elections have strengthened the republican party and cast a new spotlight on key figures such as rand paul the republican senator
why
as greenspan himself points out the sheer scale of recent monetary policy experiments has raised concerns about a future outbreak of inflation 
but there is a third more subtle psychological issue as well
most ordinary people have no idea what central banks are really doing with their trillion-dollar experiments
they are unnerved about how money works in a bottomless cyber space
but the beauty of gold is that it seems tangible clear and finite
it also seems timeless creating an impression of permanent intrinsic value
its value like that of fiat currency depends on social convention
li keqiang the chinese premier has vowed to overhaul state-dominated financial institutions liberalise interest rates and eventually make the renminbi freely convertible in a sweeping restatement of the newly installed government's economic reform agenda
he said his government intended to take "gradual and active steps towards market-based interest rates and the exchange rate of the renminbi" and "gradually achieve full convertibility of the renminbi under the capital account"
he also signalled beijing's intention to allow greater opening of the country's burgeoning financial sector which remains dominated by state-owned behemoths
the government "will reform financial institutions of various ownerships in particular we need to further ease market access to open up a broader space for financial institutions of various ownerships to develop their businesses" mr li said
his repeated use of the term "various ownerships" a catch-all phrase used to refer to private and foreign ownership will give hope to international financial institutions which face tough restrictions in china and occupy only a tiny slice of the market
although liberalisation of interest rates and renminbi convertibility are already stated policy objectives of the government mr li has rarely laid out beijing's financial reform agenda with much detail
mr li did not provide a timetable or any specifics on the government's planned reforms but in the coded language of china's communist leaders his speech indicated the importance the administration places on reforming a financial sector weighed down by masses of debt
since the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== global financial crisis china's financial system has flooded the economy with credit creating asset bubbles and overcapacity and potentially an enormous stock of future loan defaults
of particular concern has been the enormous borrowing by local governments across the country many of which appear unable to repay their debts
"regarding the local government debt issue which has become a source of concern we are taking pertinent measures to regulate and address it in an orderly fashion" he said "here i can say with certainty that the situation is on the whole safe and manageable.
the government recently commissioned a national audit of all local government debt in order to get a more accurate picture of the size of the problem and many economists and even some officials have said the problem is probably much larger than beijing has admitted
"china is now at such a crucial stage that without structural transformation and upgrading we will not be able to achieve sustained economic growth" he said "in readjusting the structure the most important aspect is to expand domestic demand.
wireless-operator sprint nextel corp pork-producer smithfield foods inc and now whiskey-maker beam inc are falling into asian hands
such multibillion-dollar purchases of us companies by asian corporations hadn't been seen since before the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==-'==NUMBER====NUMBER== financial crisis when drug maker millennium pharmaceuticals inc was purchased by japan's takeda pharmaceutical co
but the past year's deals have been bigger than ever and the targets are well-known us brands
and unlike a spate of purchases in the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s when japanese electronics company sony corp took on hollywood by purchasing columbia pictures entertainment inc asian buyers have avoided touchy areas and thus a backlash from american consumers
we have not seen such a strong phenomenon of asian firms buying us brands before i believe we will see more multibillion-dollar outbound m&as by asian companies this year said lian lian a co-head of north asia mergers and acquisitions at jp morgan chase & co
the sluggishness of the global economic recovery may encourage western firms to rationalize value expectations' and sell assets she said
japan's suntory holdings ltd said monday it would buy beam for $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion -- less than a year after softbank corp purchased sprint for $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion
the deals are part of a drive by japanese companies -- struggling with an aging population and slow growth at home -- to strengthen their offerings and boost their popularity overseas
in the softbank deal sprint received cash to help it compete with bigger rivals in the us one of the world's most lucrative markets for smartphones
in some ways suntory going for beam is not a surprise said jeremy cunnington an analyst at euromonitor international in london the company along with its fellow japanese companies has been looking to diversify away from its moribund markets and undoubtedly beam's array of international brands would make it a truly global spirits player
the deal will vault suntory to the world's sixth-largest spirits company by volume from ==NUMBER====NUMBER==th mr cunnington said
while japanese companies have been pushing to gain access to overseas markets their chinese counterparts have been making purchases to bring brands home
shuanghui international holdings ltd last year bought smithfield foods for $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion the largest purchase by a chinese company of a us one
shuanghui's purchase gave it a well-respected brand that shuanghui can take home to china -- the world's largest pork consumer -- as food scandals and increasing urbanization drive demand for a safe secure food supply
shuanghui's deal stood in contrast to a ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== attempt by oil company cnooc ltd to buy unocal corp for $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion which was thwarted by fears for us national security
asian companies bought $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion in us assets in the five years since ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== above the $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion purchased in the previous five years according to dealogic
the softbank and suntory acquisitions are bigger than the asian -- primarily japanese -- acquisitions of us assets made in the late ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s and early ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s
excluding financial services the next-biggest asian purchase of a us company was takeda's $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion purchase of millennium in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== trailed by japan tobacco incs $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion purchase in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== of the international tobacco operations of rjr nabisco holdings corp
the softbank deal still would be the biggest after adjusting for inflation
once again word has emerged of another potentially serious bidder for blackberry once again shareholders were hardly impressed
chinese pc maker lenovo group has signed a non-disclosure agreement that allows it to look at blackberry's books a signal it is actively exploring a bid
blackberry shares remain nearly ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% below the preliminary offer from fairfax financial blackberry's biggest holder
why have reports of interested parties failed to spark a rally in blackberry's shares
in the case lenovo one of its hurdles is the fact it's chinese
canadian officials have made no secret of the fact that a foreign buyer would be closely examined before being allowed to purchase a home-grown giant like blackberry
earlier this year amid speculation lenovo was interested christian paradis then canada's industry minister said it was premature to speculate how the government would rule  but that each deal was viewed on a case-by-case basis
we hope to see rim remain a global leader and player and make sure it can grow organically he also told reuters
the threat of a review was reiterated last month again by mr harper who told cnbc that all deals in the technology space would be reviewed on national security grounds
the us would also have to approve the deal
the willingness to let that deal pass increased some hopes other chinese buyers could enter canada
millions of school leavers and graduates with fairly useless' degrees are unemployable because they lack basic skills a major business lobby group will warn today
the devastating report from the british chambers of commerce reveals small businesses are frustrated at the quality of applicants who they say can barely concentrate or add up
nearly half of the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== firms surveyed said they would be fairly or very nervous' about hiring someone who has just finished their a-levels
the group questioned the owners of micro-businesses' those with fewer than ten employees many have vacancies which they are desperate to fill but were scathing about the quality of candidates
the report states in general younger people lack numerical skills research skills ability to focus and read plus written english
one unnamed entrepreneur told researchers plenty of unemployed mostly without experience in my sector the interpersonal skills of some interviewed in the past have been very poor
dr adam marshall director of policy at the british chambers of commerce said the fault lies with the education system not with the young people themselves
he said new courses spring up because there is demand from would-be students but not necessarily from businesses
dr marshall said there may be a course in underwater basket weaving but that does not mean anybody will actually want to employ you at the end of it
he cited the american television crime drama csi as a prime example
it sparked a huge growth in the popularity of forensic science courses but dr marshall said demand for these graduates is low
dr marshall said he is desperate for the country to listen to business and create the right courses to fit the jobs that are available
he said three big economic issues ought to be on the table whenpresident barack obama and china's xi jinping meet next week in california
china's trade surplus with the rest of the world measured as a share of its economy has come down in recent years
that's partly because its big customers the us and europe haven't been buying as much as they once did and partly because china has allowed its currency to gently climb which makes its exports less attractive
or as mr summers put it in econo-speak it's important for china and the us to avoid "a rewidening of imbalances on a large scale as the two economies evolve which i think would be quite unfortunate for both us economic performance and the global trading system.
there are mr summers said "a range of chinese business practices that are unacceptable in terms of what they mean for the competitive position of foreign firms.
these of course range from stealing american intellectual property to barring foreign investments from huge swatches of the big chinese economy and are a persistent annoyance to us companies in china
asked about the standards the us should use in deciding which chinese investments the us should accept mr summers said us government scrutiny is warranted when the chinese seek to invest "where the industry involved has substantial national security sensitivity in the form of possessing technological knowledge of a kind that is not otherwise available and it could be used in ways that are adverse to our national security or where the industry is sufficiently central to networks that a decision by those who control it could have substantial adverse impacts on the us economy.
the world has changed
the international financial institutions haven't changed enough in response mr summers once chief economist at the world bank suggested
is there going to be a global system
what is the role of the international monetary fund
he didn't offer any answer to those questions
"no one can forecast with confidence the future of the chinese economy" he said
"in retrospect us alarmism about japanese growth peaked at just about the same point that the japanese competitive threat to the american economy peaked
and not very long after those concerns japanese economic weakness became more of a concern for the united states than japanese economic strength
"i think that us policy makers would do well to recognize that there's an enormous range of uncertainty about possible chinese outcomes and that sustained rapid growth and greater competitive threat is one of the possibilities but it is by no means the only possibility" he said
amazon is upping its game in the color tablet market
now amazon has come up with a successor the kindle fire hd which comes in two screen sizes ==NUMBER== inches and ==NUMBER====NUMBER== inches 
again i see the key advantages of these new fires as low base prices and easy access to amazon's content offerings
the ==NUMBER==-inch model while beefed up still starts at $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== and the larger version at $==NUMBER====NUMBER==9
by contrast the latest ipad starts at $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== though the older ipad ==NUMBER== is still available at $==NUMBER====NUMBER==9
but this time amazon is facing a well-received ==NUMBER==-inch $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== competitor google's nexus ==NUMBER== which also is positioned as primarily a front end to an online content store
so while amazon is still stressing that these new fires are best seen as front doors to its online stores it is now claiming the fire hd is also the best tablet at any price
for starters its base model has ==NUMBER====NUMBER== gigabytes of storage double that of the original fire or the base nexus ==NUMBER== and equal to the base ipad
it is slimmer lighter and more stylish than its predecessor
the fire hd isn't as polished fluid or versatile as the ipad
it offers only a fraction of the third-party apps available on either the ipad or the nexus ==NUMBER== 
i found that after prolonged use the fire hd showed signs of latency -- apps and content displayed delays in launching
you have to pay amazon another $==NUMBER====NUMBER== using an obscure setting on a web page to escape these ads and there are pitches to buy more content on many other screens even those displaying your already-purchased content
the main user interface has changed
instead of a series of faux shelves displaying recently used apps and content there is now a carousel a scrolling horizontal array of these items
it also is about the same thickness as the nexus though a bit heavier
it is much lighter than the larger ipad but about ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% thicker
i found its speakers far better than those on the ipad and nexus like the original fire the fire hd is technically an android tablet
it uses last year's version of android google's mobile operating system while the nexus uses a newer more polished version
but like its predecessor the new fire buries android demoting it to mere plumbing
instead of the standard google play store for apps and content it has its own
most android apps aren't available there
the kindle fire is a service he said
for instance ipad owners can get free apps from amazon for kindle books amazon video and music
but this content and especially the ability to quickly buy it is much better integrated into the fire
the fire has some content capabilities that aren't present in amazon's ipad apps
among these are the ability to lend certain books a feature called immersion reading which lets you listen to a professional audio narration of a book as you read along and a feature called x-ray which quickly displays all the characters in a book or all the actors in a movie
but in my tests i couldn't replicate that
most web pages i tried loaded slightly faster on the ipad
and using two different speed test utilities on two different networks i found the ipad was a bit faster in almost every instance occasionally much faster
it lacks artificial-intelligence features like apple's siri or google now a feature of the nexus 7
amazon's app store has about ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== apps versus more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== for the ipad or nexus
in my harsh battery test where i set the screen at ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% brightness leave on the wi-fi to collect email in the background and play videos back to back the fire hd was respectable if not up to its claim of ==NUMBER====NUMBER== hours or as good as its competitors it lasted nine hours and ==NUMBER====NUMBER== minutes compared with just five hours and ==NUMBER====NUMBER== minutes for the original fire
that was about half an hour less than the ipad but over an hour less than the nexus
overall i see the ==NUMBER==-inch fire hd as a good value for those primarily interested in easily tapping amazon's large collection of content
a new estimate of the economic damage wrought by the japan disaster put the figure as high as $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion while insurers continued to offer early estimates of their exposure
analysts expect about ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% to ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of the economic cost of the earthquake to be borne by private insurers and reinsurers most of which have enough capital to withstand the losses
still with economic losses potentially exceeding $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== billion the event would still be one of the costliest disasters in history for the insurance industry swiss re said monday it expects claims costs of $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion from the earthquake and tsunami in japan but cautioned that its estimate is subject to a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty and may need to be adjusted as the extent of the insured losses becomes clearer
the reinsurance company said the incident at the fukushima nuclear power plant is unlikely to result in a significant direct loss for the non-life insurance industry
american international group inc last friday estimated its property and casualty business would have to pay $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million in claims arising from the japan earthquake and tsunami excluding $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million in catastrophe reserves its japanese operations earlier established for earthquake damage to people's homes
munich re the world's largest reinsurance company by premiums and hannover re both said on monday that it was too early to provide an estimate
french reinsurer scor se has said its pretax losses will likely be less than ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million 
warren buffett's berkshire hathaway inc which has an agreement to assume a ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% share of swiss re's world-wide property and casualty business is likely to face claims from the japanese quake
the omaha neb conglomerate so far hasn't provided estimates of its quake-related claims but is expected to disclose them when it reports first-quarter results
analysts from barclays capital said berkshire is likely to see a $==NUMBER== billion to $==NUMBER== billion impact a loss the cash-rich company can easily absorb
the world bank warned this week that japan's disaster could cause exports from developing nations in east asia to slow by as much as ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% as manufacturers in those countries suffer from supply-chain disruptions
korean firms are facing higher prices for memory chips and exporters of cars in thailand say current supplies of components imported from japan will last through april the world bank said
general motors cos south korean unit said monday that it will reduce production to prepare for a possible shortage of key components following a similar decision by renault sa's korean subsidiary
in addition one-fourth of the region's long-term debt is denominated in yen and appreciation of the yen increases the cost of servicing that debt the world bank report said
on a brighter note for the insurance industry the events in japan may mark a turning point for reinsurers which for several years have suffered from declining prices for the cover they provide
this event could stabilize reinsurance pricing in the months ahead as reinsurers' capital and capacity has been reduced by a string of catastrophic events during the past six months said ratings firm moody's investors service in a recent report
moody's anticipates strong reinsurance-market conditions in japan for renewals at the start of april as well as in australia and new zealand where renewals occur midyear
the rater also said that share buybacks among global reinsurers which were heavy during ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== will grind to a virtual halt as companies preserve capital for the coming atlantic hurricane season
the metal used in wiring and power cables fell to its lowest level in five years in mid-january as demand in china weakened before the new year holiday and short sellers pushed down the metal
that sentiment has temporarily eased over the past week after remarks from the federal reserve capped the dollar's dramatic rise and stocks in china traded near a seven-year high on expectations of government stimulus
copper for three months delivery rose ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent to $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== on the london metal exchange
in shanghai the most traded copper contract hit its highest level since early january
still trade data released for february highlighted the weak demand for metals
total copper metal unit imports were at the weakest levels since july ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== according to jefferies
"copper consumers are nervous and unwilling to commit while traders don't want to hold too much material over fears that prices could drop further" said gayle berry an analyst at jefferies
copper's fate this year is likely to hinge on the state of china's property market and investment in power lines by state-owned state grid
on the supply side the market is expected to be balanced according to analysts
for the price to rise further there would need to be seasonal improvement in chinese industrial demand normally between february and may says tom price analyst at morgan stanley
china's equity markets are notoriously volatile
but in recent days they have been especially so
after tumbling ==NUMBER== per cent on tuesday shanghai stocks are now down almost ==NUMBER== per cent in the past three trading sessions
investors across the world are taking note
"the key concern and the reason the market sold off is that inflation particularly food inflation is proving stronger than expectations this is something that really worries communist politicians" says chris ruffle a fund manager at martin currie in shanghai
data last week showed that consumer price inflation rose to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent in october from ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent the month before its highest level in more than two years and well above the government's target of ==NUMBER== per cent
while those levels are mild compared with the double-digit price rises of the ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s and ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==s there has been a disproportionate ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent surge in food prices which is hitting poor households especially hard
the big question now is what the communist party will do to contain inflation and thereby suppress the risk of social unrest
"the government's top priority has now switched from guaranteeing growth to controlling rising prices" says arthur kroeber of dragonomics a beijing-based research boutique
beijing has already started tightening liquidity following last year's un-precedented government- directed lending spree that saw total new loans in the economy nearly double to rmb==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn 
officials last week increased commercial bank reserve requirements by ==NUMBER====NUMBER== basis points and in october the people's bank of china raised interest rates for the first time in more than two years
these moves are only the beginning says mr kroeber
"further tightening measures will be needed to keep inflation in check.
yet many analysts and investors including mr ruffle of martin currie reckon that shanghai's recent decline represents a buying opportunity rather than the start of a long-term bear market
indeed equity valuations are not expensive by historical standards with the shanghai composite trading at ==NUMBER====NUMBER== times forecast earnings for the current financial year according to bloomberg data or a ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent discount to its average over the past five years
"valuations are still far from over-stretched levels seen in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== when rate hikes induced more profit taking" says helen zhu of goldman sachs
but shares listed in shenzhen china's second stock exchange are pricier
anthony bolton the star stockpicker at fidelity international says he remains bullish on chinese stocks and describes china as "the investment opportunity of the next decade.
however he adds that chinese companies listed on offshore exchanges such as hong kong are generally trading at more attractive valuations than those in shanghai and shenzhen
of course chinese equity prices have less to do with what investors believe are companies' fundamental valuations and more with speculation and the amount of money sloshing through the financial system
as things stand so-called "excess liquidity" remains abundant as the m==NUMBER== measure of money supply is still growing at a faster pace than the economy
at the same time expectations that the renminbi the chinese currency will appreciate against the us dollar in the coming months and years are fuelling big inflows of "hot money" into the country's asset markets
china's foreign exchange reserves increased by $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn in september the largest ever monthly increase although only $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn of that inflow could be explained by the trade balance and foreign direct investment
with the federal reserve pouring $==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==bn into the global financial system through a second round of quantitative easing and with us interest rates still close to zero hot money inflows into china show little sign of stopping
state media have reported that the authorities are considering the introduction of price controls in food and other commodity markets
this would hit companies in those sectors hard as their revenues would be limited at a time when wages and other costs are continuing to rise
"governments usually tend to adopt some form of price control measures when inflation becomes a social issue" says vincent chan at credit suisse who reckons that sectors such as property utilities and oil product refiners are most vulnerable
the best performers will be companies with high fixed costs strong pricing power low leverage and low policy risk he says
the risk to this view is that inflation will prove more stubborn and dangerous than expected prompting beijing to unveil a sweeping move like aggressively cutting bank lending quotas
if that were to happen the shockwaves would ripple far beyond shanghai
weakness in emerging market currencies is hurting global trade by reducing imports without any benefit to export volumes according to financial times research on more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== countries the findings suggest that an
currency war between developing nations is likely to be even more damaging than previously thought leading to a reduction in global trade and possibly economic growth rather than just reapportioning a fixed level of trade between "winners" and "losers"
the analysis coincides with concerns that some countries are engaging in competitive devaluations in order to undercut their neighbours and steal market share
since june ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== the currencies of russia colombia brazil turkey mexico and chile have fallen between ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent and ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent against the dollar while the malaysian ringgit and indonesian rupiah are at their weakest since the asian financial crisis of ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==8
china which had held the renminbi firm against the dollar until this month has since allowed it to fall ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent triggering a further wave of currency weakness across emerging markets
the analysis found that having a weaker currency did not lead to any rise in export volumes
however it did lead to a fall in import volumes of about ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent for every ==NUMBER== per cent a currency depreciated against the dollar
a fall in the value of a country's currency pushes up the price of imports leading to lower demand for imported goods
top chinese banks have halted most dealings with north korea an unprecedented move to use financial leverage against pyongyang that reflects beijing's exasperation with kim jong-eun's regime
the financial blockade against north korea goes beyond what beijing had agreed to implement in un resolutions with several leading banks saying they had stopped all cross-border cash transfers regardless of the nature of the business
a un resolution this year called only for sanctions in cases where money might contribute to north korea's missile programmes
nevertheless the blockade is not watertight
a smaller bank based in northeast china said it was still handling large cross-border transfers a sign beijing is not cutting off north korea
trade bet-ween the two has grown providing a cash lifeline to the impoverished state
but diplomatic ties have suffered
mr kim has yet to visit china since taking power and has rebuffed chinese entreaties to refrain from missile tests
concerned about the consequences for regional security beijing has started to usesanctions
"we welcome these steps to protect the financial system from illicit north korean activity" said a senior us treasury official
bank of china the country's primary institution for foreign exchange transactions said last week it had closed the account of foreign trade bank north ko-rea's main foreign exchange bank
but asked whether it had also frozen other dealings with north korea the bank declined to comment
cai jian an expert on north korea at shanghai's fudan university said it appeared to be the first time that chinese banks had taken such co-ordinated action against pyongyang
"previously even when china signed on to sanctions against north korea there was still a lot of economic activity between our two countries" he said "this time i think china's banks received orders from the government to cut ties.
yet em corporate credit has held up better than us high yield
the fact that energy figures more prominently in em corporate benchmarks makes this outperformance more intriguing
some argue that the relative resilience is explained simply by the fact that most em corporate credit is investment grade
however ratings are not the assuring anchor they once were our credit riskmetrics suggest that em ratings have only begun a process of being cut several notches
the real reason em corporates have been able to avoid serious stress is that about ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of outstanding paper is issued by partially or wholly government-owned companies
in energy a sector still under pressure despite the modest rebound in oil prices the government ownership ratio is close to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
"the sovereign will not let the quasi-sovereign default" is a much too common refrain in em investment circles and it is very likely correct
but even as governments can delay the pain for some companies their involvement also engineers a transmission of pain from credit to other assets
in the us default rates in the energy sector are expected to rise to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== a grim reflection of over-investment
default rates ex-energy and materials are below long-term averages
given the strong negative correlations between high yield spreads and government bond yields one may argue that as energy companies confront stress the cost of equity for a typical non-energy company falls
not so in eM
as em governments suppress corporate trouble their own credit risk will probably rise nudging their yields higher
the cost of equity then rises for every company even those that are fundamentally sound in sectors unrelated to the one in trouble
the accepted wisdom is that low public debt ratios compared with developed markets will enable em governments to retain a very generous fiscal stance for a good while yet
however em's weaker institutions shallower markets and under-developed debt resolution mechanisms invalidate a like-for-like comparison with developed-economy public debt
a link that reinforces the loop of trouble between em corporates and sovereigns is the financial sector which also happens to be the largest issuer of hard-currency debt in eM
the non-performing loan cycle in em has yet to manifest itself fully even though debt service ratios for the private sector are higher than in developed markets
that is because investors both external and local have been happy to roll over maturing debt until recently
but rising leverage and a more elevated opportunity cost of global capital are whittling down investors' appetite at a time when em refinancing needs are rising
there are warning signs aplenty over in em equities which are less interested in a company's capacity to touch its parent for a quick penny and more focused on its ability to generate profits
it is a damning statement on em corporate management that the return on equity has fallen even though leverage has gone up state-owned enterprises have been centre stage in this act
so far em equity investors have had to deal with weak earnings and a low return on equity
the pain in em corporate credit will begin with a lag but it is very likely to demand more than its pound of flesh
and the collateral damage will be broader and may last longer than in developed markets

one of the major challenges we face in emerging markets is piracy the primary reason why people pirate is because of the initial up-front cost of perpetual licensing it's not that they're evil it's just that the value proposition of piracy is stronger if you turn that on its head and say $==NUMBER== per user per month and you can get email as a business -- that's much easier to consume than the up-front cost of a perpetual licensing agreement
investor sentiment towards china has undergone an extraordinary shift from exuberance to caution in just two weeks but the swing may be overdone says jing ulrich managing director and chairman of china equities and commodities at jpmorgan
"a fortnight ago the mood among institutions could only be described as maximum bullish'" she says "now investors have turned extremely wary given china's move towards tightening and the forceful measures being employed to curb inflation.
ms ulrich says talk of price controls recalls ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== when china controlled food prices capped coal costs and delayed power tariff adjustments
"these actions helped set a negative tone for chinese equities" she says "but this time around china's economic fundamentals are strong earnings forecast revisions have been on an uptrend and inflationary pressures while worrying are not as intense as in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==8

the new york stock exchange the cornerstone of american capitalism for ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== years agreed to be sold as part of an $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion takeover by intercontinentalexchange inc
the takeover also would seal the triumph of electronic trading over open outcry floor trading that long dominated financial markets as well as the push by exchanges to embrace new and lucrative kinds of trading
but it is too late to stop the erosion of the big board's clout so far this year the iconic trading floor has handled just ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of all trading volume in nyse-listed stocks down from more than ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== according to analysts at sandler o'neill + partners lP
the trading floor is going to become like the roman forum said wall street historian charles geisst a manhattan college finance professor it'll be a nice place to visit but nothing much will go on there
the proposed takeover also comes as new regulations are changing how wall street trades complex derivatives tied to the value of underlying stocks commodities and other securities
ice's main business is energy-futures trading and executives have long coveted nyse's london-based liffe its prized uk futures market
the pie is shrinking and their slice of it is shrinking said justin schack managing director and partner of new york brokerage firm rosenblatt securities inc
.
ice and nyse both failed to pull off separate mergers in the past year and a half
ice tried jointly with nasdaq omx group to buy nyse for about $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion and split it up and nyse attempted to merge with deutsche boerse aG
in a telephone interview with the journal on thursday conducted jointly with nyse chief duncan niederauer ice founder and chief executive jeffrey sprecher said he tried hard to scuttle the planned nyse-deutsche boerse merger last year and didn't know if my friendship with duncan would survive or not
soon after following an ice earnings call mr niederauer shot him an email congrats it said
good call
he realized it was business mr sprecher said thursday
for months the chief executives chatted on the phone lunched together and bantered about merging their businesses
things got serious only about eight weeks ago
neither ice nor nyse wanted the cost or distraction of another failed merger they said thursday
at the same time said the nyse chief you can't just put your head in the sand and say wow we tried once
in september at a meeting of the nyse euronext board directors discussed strategy with nyse management mr niederauer said
we should only be talking about things where there is a high certainty of closing a deal he recalled being said in that discussion
the executives decided to evaluate options such as a sale according to people with knowledge of the discussions
in the final weeks ahead of the deal mr niederauer had a pragmatic view that left as a stand-alone company nyse would likely begin to falter within a few years said one person involved in the discussions
the executive's attitude was very much about control your destiny this person said
the sale of london metal exchange operator lme holdings ltd announced in june brought that sentiment into sharper focus people with knowledge of the discussions said
hong kong exchanges & clearing ltd bought lme holdings for about $==NUMBER====NUMBER== billion this month a price almost double what the sellers had initially thought it would fetch according to one person familiar with lme's thinking
nyse executives believed that liffe -- the european derivatives business that came with the big board's merger with euronext in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== -- alone could be worth the roughly $==NUMBER== billion market capitalization at that time of the entire nyse euronext a person familiar with the discussions said
advisers for nyse euronext including boutique bank perella weinberg partners studied the feasibility of combinations with other exchange operators including a preliminary exploration with cme group inc but the company quickly decided that a merger with ice would present the least amount of risk the people familiar those deliberations said
in early october ice and nyse euronext began serious one-on-one negotiations said people with knowledge of the talks
the two ceos who led much of the talks reached an agreement on the per-share price range by phone one of the people said
the merger agreement was drawn up in new york where nyse is based and atlanta where ice is based
about six weeks ago mr niederauer and his team drew up a timetable that culminated in a planned announcement on dec ==NUMBER====NUMBER==th people familiar with the matter said
he chose that date based partly on the timing of meetings with regulators in europe and elsewhere they added
they both really need each other said neal wolkoff former chairman and chief executive of the american stock exchange which was bought by nyse in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== who now is consultant and lawyer with richardson & patel llP
as for nyse the dominance of high-frequency traders which make rapid-fire trades using complex computer programs has forced cost-cutting and lowered exchanges' profits while a lot of stock trading has moved off exchanges altogether
mr wolkoff said he expects ice to shake up nyse's culture by cutting costs and putting much less focus on appearance of business and the ritual of the floor
by the time the nyse started to catch up it was too late said georges ugeux a former european executive of nyse and now a consultant in new york for galileo global advisors only in the last few years has it truly become a technology company
if apple inc vs samsung electronics co is a battle of the titans then here is a david and goliath story
!
although it's the world's biggest motherboard maker and fifth-largest laptop maker by shipments asustek -- whose computers are sold under the asus' brand -- is still unfamiliar to many western consumers
while it's far from a sure bet that asustek can vault past larger tablet competitors such as south korea's samsung -- currently the world's second biggest tablet maker by shipments -- analysts say its latest low-priced offerings at least gives it a seat at the big kids' table of the mobile computing realm
it's also been targeting the us market this year by for instance starting up a twitter presence in may
asustek chief financial officer david chang said monday that the company expects to ship ==NUMBER====NUMBER== million android tablets in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== up ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==% from ==NUMBER====NUMBER== million in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==2
it expects combined windows notebook and tablet shipments to grow ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== million units in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== from ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== million this year
mr chang says he believes the popularity of seven-inch tablets can boost the company to second place in combined tablet and notebook shipments after apple next year
the company's quarterly tablet shipments have tripled since the launch of the nexus ==NUMBER== in july
but analysts say silver medal is still a lofty goal for this little-known taiwanese company which takes its name from the hind half of pegasus the mythical winged horse
in the third quarter asustek ranked fourth among tablet makers with ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% of the market behind apple with ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==% samsung with ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==% and amazoncom inc with ==NUMBER====NUMBER==% according to market researcher idC
china will maintain its tightening measures in property sectors next year and continue its efforts to construct affordable housing state-run media reported sunday citing vice premier li keqiang
there has been speculation among some economists that authorities may ease controls on the property market if a steep drop in prices threatens economic growth
tightening measures in the property sector have had a certain effect mr li said the market is entering a critical period so we must stick to the policy stance of curbing [the] overly fast increase of housing prices
the high cost of housing has been a key complaint across the country and beijing views the problem as a potential source of social unrest
since april ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== china has launched a raft of measures to curb property prices including higher down-payments limits on the number of residences people can own the introduction of a property tax in some cities and the construction of low-income housing
mr li also urged local governments to ensure the construction of affordable housing and the quality of such homes
construction of affordable housing will give a large boost to consumption and investment which are key to china amid the global economic slowdown mr li said
the country plans to start construction on ==NUMBER====NUMBER== million units of public housing this year as part of its effort to build ==NUMBER====NUMBER== million units of public housing from ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== to ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==5
do not tell jamie dimon who warned he "wouldn't want to see the next jpmorgan chase be a chinese company" but universal banking is gaining traction among mainland chinese lenders
last month three of china's four largest banks reported annual declines in fourth-quarter earnings for the first time since ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==9
as elsewhere clouds are gathering in addition to tougher capital requirements chinese lenders have to deal with interest-rate deregulation and rising bad loans on the back of an economic slowdown
that is driving banks to look elsewhere for income says zeng gang director of bank research at the chinese academy of social sciences' institute of finance and banking
"pure lending business is based on interest margins but with interest-rate liberalisation margins are shrinking and risks are rising intermediary fees are another source of income with investment bank and wealth management as the main portion.
china which has traditionally maintained a strict glass-steagall-style separation between commercial and investment banking bans commercial banks from underwriting initial public offerings or acting as broker-dealers in the stock market the two biggest revenue sources for securities companies
but bond underwriting wealth management m&a advisory and custodial services have all emerged as areas of competition between banks and brokerages
and last month the china securities regulatory commission stunned markets by announcing it was considering issuing brokerage licences to commercial banks that sent brokerage stocks which have outperformed china's red-hot equity market in recent months plunging
analysts say that commercial banks whose client base and physical branch networks dwarf those of securities companies would quickly dominate the sector if regulators granted approval
 however the spectre of rivals to challenge western counterparts conjured up by jpmorgan's mr dimon remains an unlikely one
while china's banks tower above their global peers by the size of their balance sheets they lag far behind in terms of revenue from non-lending businesses
recent earnings reports show that banks are diversifying
at industrial and commercial bank of china the country's largest bank income from asset management for corporations rose ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent to rmb==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn  faster than the bank's ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent growth in overall operating income
investment banking income which includes bond underwriting structured finance mergers and acquisitions advisory and private equity rose ==NUMBER== per cent to rmb==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn following ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent growth in ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER==3
yet total non-interest income at icbc which includes investment banking wealth management bank cards settlement and other fees was only ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of total operating income last year less than half the ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent ratio at jpmorgan
smaller banks are also getting in on the act
at ping an bank non-interest income rose ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent increasing its share in the bank's total operating income by six percentage points to ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent
investment banking custodial services bill issuance and gold leasing were the main growth drivers the bank said
small and midsized banks are generating fees by packaging off-balance-sheet loans into high-yielding wealth management products

since rapid-fire trading firms now provide many of the buy and sell orders that support the market investors are at the mercy of automated systems that can run amok during volatile times according to dave lauer who last year quit his job as a trader for an elite chicago high-frequency trading outfit
mr lauer is part of a growing chorus of industry insiders blowing the whistle on approved trading techniques that they say are designed by the traders who derive the most benefit
mr lauer is now a consultant on market-structure issues for better markets a washington dc advocacy group funded by a hedge fund
high-frequency trading accounts for some two-thirds of all trading volume experts say
the sec is conducting an inquiry into whether high-frequency firms use those order types to jump in front of other investors

when silchester bought into the south china morning post the fund manager was investing in a group once touted as the most profitable newspaper in the world
seventeen years later the media landscape has changed dramatically but silchester's investment has not partly because scmp group shares have been frozen since ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== by hong kong rules that allow stocks to languish for years without being traded
the issue is a source of frustration for investors particularly given the city's status as asia's leading stock market and the gateway to china
"we find the whole saga astounding we would not expect such an affair in any developed stock market" says stephen butt chairman and chief executive of silchester international investors which holds ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent of scmp group
"our clients who include many leading international foundations endowments and charities are suffering why should their interests be abused in this way and to whose benefit?
about $==NUMBER====NUMBER==bn of equity capital is trapped in companies that have not traded in at least three months a number that will more than double if hanergy thin film frozen for six weeks following its spectacular fall from grace does not resume trading soon
hong kong is not alone in allowing shares to be suspended or demanding it if circumstances require but what sets it apart is the length of time shareholders can be stuck in a deep freeze
the scmp group was suspended in february ==NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER====NUMBER== after its free float dropped below the ==NUMBER====NUMBER== per cent minimum required by the exchange
scmp group says its board has frequently discussed possible resolutions and is working closely with regulators and shareholders
the market value of the trapped capital is likely to grow by a third next week if tianhe chemical does not begin trading in the meantime
 tianhe's shares rose rapidly after listing last june but it fell foul of short sellers in september since when its share price has halved
suspension leaves would-be sellers reliant on finding a buyer privately as hong kong has no equivalent to the us over-the-counter "pink sheets" market
