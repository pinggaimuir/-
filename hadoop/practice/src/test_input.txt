It was morning in early September and senior investors at Carmignac, the French fund manager, were engaged in a debate that they had been having for months: just how fragile was the world economy?
Now, digesting the impact of an August decision by the Chinese authorities to let the value of the renminbi drop only slightly, it was finally time to act.
They would effectively pull out of the stock market and wait to see what happened.
After a vicious sell-off, markets recovered their poise and in December the US Federal Reserve was sufficiently confident about the outlook to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
But in recent weeks, Carmignac's decision has looked like the right call: January has been a disaster for stock markets, which have never fallen so far or so fast at the start of a year.
"Our interpretation of the         Chinese accident was that this is the canary in the coal mine, that this is the first material impact of the end of quantitative easing," says Didier Saint-Georges, strategist for the French asset manager.
Global stock markets have lost over $4tn of value already this year.
The fears about China's economic slowdown and depreciating currency have erupted into near-panic.
Chinese stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen have lost a fifth of their value in the first two weeks of January.
Benchmark indices in Japan and Europe and the US have fallen by as much as 10 per cent.
Commodity prices have tumbled downwards, with oil selling for less than $28 a barrel, a price last seen in 2004.
A spiral of pessimism is developing, with prominent strategists and investors telling clients to pull out of stocks and head for the safety of government bonds.
Alongside worries about slowing growth in China, investors are concerned about weakening US corporate profits, the health of mining groups and energy companies that took on debts when prices for raw materials were far higher, and the consequences of collapsing energy prices.
So US investors will return on Tuesday after a long weekend looking for the answer to a question: what can restore confidence, not just to China but to the rest of the world?
At stake is the credibility of policymakers around the globe, in particular the Fed, which last month raised overnight borrowing costs for the first time in a decade.
Notably, the US central bank delayed a widely expected borrowing shift last September after the market turmoil triggered by China's surprise devaluation of the renminbi.
"The Fed will find it much more difficult to raise rates now, with equities down 8 per cent this year, oil making new lows, and concerns increasing that inflation will take even longer to reach the 2 per cent target,'' says Arthur Bass, managing director at Coex Partners.
The challenge facing policymakers is that investors continue their exit from commodities, shares and corporate bonds, spurring a stampede that hurts confidence among companies and consumers.
After the financial crisis, central banks took exceptional measures to stimulate their economies, but growth has been disappointing.
The Fed is supposed to have closed the door on the post-crisis era, but with interest rates still close to zero and scant prospect of fiscal stimulus, the worry is that policymakers have exhausted the tools available to them.
Some argue market turbulence will force the authorities in China to pull together a package of stimulus measures before the Chinese new year on February 8, when markets close for at least three days and business slows down.
Yet the concern is that a viable package of measures needs more time to be put together, with China's credibility already dented by its apparent hasty actions: from forced stock-buying by the so-called "national team" last summer to the abandonment of "circuit breakers", which imposed trading halts on plunging stock markets this month.
"What announcement can they make? They've made a lot of them already," asks Xingdong Chen, chief China economist at BNP Paribas. "Cutting reserve ratios doesn't seem to be working in the way that they'd want. Can they say they're using a speculative vehicle in the stock market?
Attempts to manage the renminbi have only added to concerns.
The People's Bank of China has continued to spend foreign currency reserves to protect the renminbi, and intervened in markets to narrow the gap between the offshore exchange rate and the onshore rate it controls.
For now, hopes for a confidence boost from Beijing in the near term may be misplaced, as many seasoned China watchers say that authorities in Beijing will be loath to introduce anything radical before the meeting of G20 central bank governors in mid-February.
China is the host of this year's meeting and has a record of suppressing market volatility in the lead-up to events where it will be in the spotlight.
In the absence of action, investors in the rest of the world may be tempted to take a lead from the Chinese stock markets.
George Magnus, associate at Oxford university's China Centre and a senior economic adviser to UBS, argues a Chinese economy growing at 3 or 4 per cent a year, while far slower than seen in the past decade, would not be a problem for the rest of the world.
"It's been very fashionable to equate financial turbulence with a global recession around the corner, but I don't think that's correct.".
Still, the direction for China is just one of the larger issues facing investors.
"The level of uncertainty visible in markets can be traced to two sources: China and oil," says Craig Botham, emerging markets economist at Schroders. "And both have been extremely difficult for investors to call, which is why no one is sure what the end point of this is."
Following the decision of western authorities to lift a number of sanctions against Iran, global oil prices fell to a 12-year low yesterday, putting further pressure on developing economies that rely on exporting commodities.
"We're seeing lower capital spending in emerging markets and high yield credit weakness in the US yet we're not seeing the consumer boost that low oil prices might provide," says Mr Botham, who sees in market movements "a lot of worry about the weakness of the global trade recovery".
Indeed, Standard & Poor's counted 112 corporate bond defaults last year, the most since 2009.
Stress at indebted companies also rose significantly in the past six months, with the biggest increase in the proportion of companies judged to be at risk of a downgrade to their credit rating in six years.
The US stock market is also said to have narrowed, a sign of a market running out of momentum after years of upward movement.
Indeed, equities, corporate debt and government bonds are all pricing in a 50 per cent chance of a recession this year, according to Jan Loeys, a senior strategist at JPMorgan, who argues sentiment has become too pessimistic and detached from the reality of economic data.
"If we are indeed in the last inning of the US expansion and within half a year of recession, then the current sell-off of risk markets makes sense. But that development is not our view," he wrote in a report this weekend.
A procession of good economic data, including employment figures for the US economy due on February 5, could start to restore confidence among investors.
That is echoed by Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, who highlights the weak links between China and the US and Europe.
Even in Mr Hatzius's more adverse scenarios, where Chinese growth slows sharply from Goldman's already pessimistic 5 per cent current estimate     well below the official forecast of about 7 per cent     the global impact is painful but manageable, and far from enough to plunge the world into a new recession.
After a difficult first 10 trading days of the year, this is perhaps the most favourable outcome for investors: one in which the problems they see do not disappear but are at least contained.
In this scenario, commodity prices are a reflection of excessive boom-time investment by the industries that mine and pump them, rather than a slump in global demand.
Low global interest rates will ultimately spur a steady recovery in economic activity.
And China's pains reflect the transition from a rapidly industrialising nation to a society whose economy is driven by services and domestic consumption.
It is possible that markets signal a very difficult year for investors and crisis-stretched policymakers without implying imminent disaster.
"China is a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy," says Mr Magnus. "You know what happens in the end, it's just a question of how many acts it takes to get there."

For 30 years, China has prospered thanks to a low-wage, high-investment growth model--one in which workers see only a fraction of the fruits of growth and corporate profits are plowed back into ever greater capacity.
That model, though, is changing: the recent strike over unpaid social insurance payments that affected an Adidas and Nike supplier in southern China shows how workers are becoming more aggressive.
If China successfully manages to move from an investment-focused economy to a consumption-based one, such a shift will have an impact on the rest of the world too.
That's especially true for the U.S., which has long ginned up its own consumption by selling Treasury bonds and other assets to foreign investors.
These are the issues Stephen Roach, a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia who is now at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, examines in his book Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China.
America needs to start saving more, he says, while China needs to start serving its own consumers -- starting with a better social safety net.
Edited excerpts:
There's a lot of misinformation and outdated views about China in the U.S.
It looks at excess investment or low consumption or rising debt and concludes that China is doomed.
The U.S. misses the fact that China not only has a different system but it also is at a totally different stage in its development.
It's certainly facing some daunting problems, but moving from a producer model to a consumer model built on urbanization still requires very high investment ratios.
It still requires an active government promoting state-directed infrastructure and real estate construction.
We can't rely on our own model to assess China's progress or lack thereof.
Most developing economies do get caught in the middle-income trap largely because they stick with the same model that led them from early-stage development to middle income and they think it can provide the impetus for moving to higher income -- and it usually doesn't.
China's changing the model, which is important, and so I'm optimistic China is on a course to escape this dreaded trap.
One word: strategy.
Strategies don't always work, but all economies need some form of strategy.
We operate on a very short-term basis.
That constrains us from being proactive and planning for the future on issues like saving, U.S. competitiveness, and how to address income inequality.
We don't have courageous leaders who are willing to take those risks.
That bubble burst and they're left with no savings.
The saving rate now is close to 4%, versus a 30-year average of about 9.5% at the end of the last century.
It's as low as it's ever been for any leading nation in modern history.
We need to expand existing incentives like 401-Ks and IRAs, we need to provide savings incentives explicitly for low-income individuals.
Then we need to address the current unsustainable monetary policy, in which zero interest rates have crushed returns for a generation of savers.
These policies were put in place in the depths of a horrific crisis.
They were emergency measures.
The emergency is long over, and yet the policies are still on emergency settings.
When excess liquidity gets combined with what's still a weak economy with considerable slack in labor and product markets, the odds suggest that it shows up in asset markets, either at home or abroad.
It's a recipe for instability in financial markets and for potential future bubbles.
Which bubbles they are, no one knows.
You emphasize that China needs to provide more in the way of social benefits if it is to bring down its very high saving rate.
Do you think America's welfare state is adequate -- or over-generous? It's not perfect. We have massive unfunded liabilities in both our retirement system and in healthcare. But we at least have a well-defined system of contributions and benefits.
China doesn't have that.
The lack of a well-funded and secure safety net, both for healthcare and retirement, is a main reason why the saving rate is excessively high for Chinese households and continues to go higher.
That will impede a consumer-led transformation.
So much so that in 2012 China was the third most popular destination for globally mobile students at higher education level, according to the Institute of International Education, the US-based, non-profit research and information body.
"In the old days, first they had to learn Chinese," she adds.
Attracting 8 per cent of the 4.3m world total of globally mobile students, China is snapping on the heels of the UK, which has 11 per cent of the total.
The US is the most preferred destination with 19 per cent of the pie, according to the latest Project Atlas report on student mobility from the IIE.
In 2001, when the IIE first started compiling its data, China did not figure in its top eight country list.
Certainly, provision of business education in English in China appears to be accelerating.
This month the Chinese University of Hong Kong will welcome the first students on its Shenzhen campus, just across the border from Hong Kong.
The undergraduate students have been able to choose from programmes offered by the school of management and economics, as well as science, engineering and humanities programmes.
The Shenzhen initiative follows hot on the heels of London Business School's announcement in June that it would team up with Fudan University in Shanghai to teach a double degree masters in management programme from September 2015.
The high profile tie-up adds to Fudan's other alliances with leading western business education providers, including MIT Sloan School of Management and the Olin Business School at Washington University in St Louis, both in the US, BI Norwegian Business School, The University of Hong Kong, Korea University Business School, and NUS Business School in Singapore.
Also in June came the news that Cornell University's Johnson School and Tsinghua University in Beijing would be teaching a double degree MBA together.
Similarly, Duke University's Fuqua School of Business has just launched its first programme from its joint venture with Wuhan University in Kunshan, a city in Jiangsu province just west of Shanghai.
Duke follows early movers such as the University of Nottingham which has just celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of its campus in Ningbo, a city on China's east coast.
The school's website boasts that its masters programmes attract participants from more than 20 countries.
Other schools have also dipped their toes in the water without making a commitment to establishing a full-scale campus.
But with all this increase in English language business education provision, there are some concerns about the quality and content of what is being taught and questions about its long-term impact.
"Foreign schools could risk diluting their brand value," says Michael Pettis, professor of finance at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. He says some prestigious schools are setting up shop in a manner not unlike how a French fashion label might open a boutique in a wealthy area of Beijing or Shanghai.
Prof Bastin, who has taught in China since the 1990s, says overseas business schools have a particular advantage.
Ceibs in Shanghai, which is ranked 17th in the FT Global MBA 2014 ranking, attracts large numbers of international students.
Established in 1994 as a joint venture between the Chinese government and the European Commission, the autonomous school is also able to pick from among the best Chinese applicants.
"China is becoming more and more part of the world economy and the need for ambitious individuals to communicate with the outside world is increasing," says Hellmut Sch  tte, dean of Ceibs. He says China needs the international business education that it is now trying to encourage and that it benefits both overseas and local Chinese students to have that education provided in English.
"Foreign participants bring the urgently needed cross-cultural dimension into the classroom," he says, adding that Chinese is not a language students can learn in a few months.
However, the rapid opening of China's education system to foreign influence could bring its own dynamic, Prof Pettis points out.
For Prof Bastin, the answer could be interesting.
"You can't have the sort of education system we have in the west without political change," he says.
In May the Haas School of Business at University of California, Berkeley, launched an executive level programme to provide what it calls a "Silicon Valley perspective on business, innovation and leadership" tailored to senior Chinese leaders.
This takes place at the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong .
"I'm trying to maximise the long-term reputation of Berkeley Haas. It's ultimately about reputation," says Prof Lyons, adding that Celap's students are particularly influential.
The May cohort of students, he says, included "a bunch of Chinese vice-ministers".
Top of the curriculum list was sustainable urban development.
Financial risk management and entrepreneurship were also popular.
"China's low-cost advantage has been eroded. Labour costs have gone up so you have to turn to creativity and innovation and you need to turn to business education to help that."
Overseas institutions who do get it right will gain immeasurably in the long run, he says.
Every organisation has ghosts.
Not shrieking spooks exactly, but the sort of behavioural ectoplasm that clings to companies long after change has supposedly swept through.
Spectres of past successes haunt the board and frighten investors, while staff in pursuit of new goals have to wade through psychomagnotheric slime to get there.
Ghost structures and habits are particularly persistent at established companies.
But newer groups also need ghostbusters.
Twitter, which continues to tinker with its hierarchy and misfiring model, is a good example of a company still spooked by the spirit that first enlivened it.
Exorcists should always be on standby at start-ups, where behaviour that seemed fresh in the first phase of growth often reeks of recklessness by the second or third round of funding.
Two big problems stand in the way of ghostfinders-general.
As leaders of the organisation, they were often the champions of the type of behaviour that now holds it back.
"We're asking them to change the things that got them there in the first place," says Jonathan Trevor of Oxford's Sad Business School.
The second related problem is that outmoded habits are often the same as the ones that knitted the old organisation together.
These informal frameworks are sometimes referred to as "truces"     uneasy coalitions between feuding factions, based on embedded routines.
End the truce and you end the fragile peace.
"Habits become institutionalised: a set of routines, procedures and rules which define us and give us identity," Sir Anthony Salz wrote in his 2013 report into how Barclays' business practices went bad. "Everyone defends their identity."
There is no real reason why, as a columnist, I should be at my desk as the first edition print deadline nears, but here I almost always am.
Pressing technological change makes it even more urgent to know how to end the haunting.
A pre-internet episode from Citigroup's history shows how.
When John Reed, then chief executive of the banking group, sought to tackle a crisis in commercial real estate that took the company to the brink of collapse, he needed several goes to make the changes that saved it.
Despite the depth of the problem, mere exhortation did not work.
He had to break the structure     by getting rid of the three executives who oversaw fiefdoms outside his control     and destroy ingrained bad habits.
To cut costs, for instance, he scrapped bonuses, but also forbade staff from using cover sheets on faxes , told them to take taxis not limousines, and started charging for canteen meals.
The signal was clear.
As he put it in a private memo: "Much of this waste is habit. A style issue of how we have grown to run the place'...
?We need the courage to change our ways and embrace them."
Mr Reed opened his private correspondence to Sarah Kaplan of Toronto's Rotman management school for a recent study.
The amount people are paid sends one signal.
At Barclays, the Salz review found that "pay contributed significantly to a sense among a few [investment bankers] that they were somehow unaffected by the ordinary rules".
More important, though, is to change the stimuli that affect behaviour.
As Prof Trevor has written, whether the strategy, purpose and structure of companies are aligned often makes the difference between a good organisation and a bad one.
Expunging phantasms is essential, but not enough.
Leaders also need to make new truces, lest the dead hand of past behaviour strangles new ways of working.
A new Pentagon forecast showing the total cost of owning and operating a fleet of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters topping $1 trillion over more than 50 years has caused a case of sticker shock in Washington.
And that price tag doesn't even include the $385 billion the Defense Department will spend to purchase 2,500 of the stealthy planes through 2035.
During a Senate hearing this month, Sen. John McCain  called the $1 trillion figure jaw-dropping,  particularly when compared with the costs of operating other aircraft.
I appreciate this estimate is still early and subject to change, but we need to know that the program is going to bring that number down,  he said.
The long-range estimate is, by its nature, imprecise because it attempts to forecast factors including inflation and fuel costs decades into the future.
And the Pentagon says it will be adjusted as the planes enter operation.
But the figure is bringing new scrutiny to what is already the Pentagon's largest-ever weapon-buying project as its budget comes under pressure.
Christine Fox, head of the Pentagon's cost-assessment office, said in Senate testimony that the F-35 would likely cost about 33% more per flight hour to operate than two of the aircraft it will replace, the F-16 and F-18.
The Marine Corps version of the F-35 will be able to hover and land vertically.
The Navy model will operate from aircraft carriers, while the Air Force version will be based on land.
Developmental aircraft are flying, and the first F-35s -- which cost about $113 million each -- are slated to enter service later in the decade.
The Pentagon's forecast includes all the possible costs the military might incur over the lifetime of the program, including everything from housing the aircraft to installing replacement parts.
Add all those together, and factor in inflation, Mr. Burbage said, and you trip the trillion-dollar mark.
But, he said, The question to ask is, is that a relevant number?
The Joint Strike Fighter has long been a troubled program, with cost overruns, military management shake-ups and heightened political scrutiny, but Lockheed says the aircraft is now ahead of schedule on its test flights.
Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Lockheed Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Stevens said the trillion-dollar figure was derived from a new Pentagon selected acquisition report  that wasn't developed by the company, and said the company would work to find ways to bring down the aircraft's long-term production and sustainment costs.
As big as that number is, there are sufficiently large opportunities to reduce that number by making streamlining decisions along the way,  he said.
On days like yesterday, there is little to do but wait for the casualty count at the end.
Even with the US on holiday, the sell-off was the worst single day for global equity markets since the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001.
Data this year has confirmed trends that had looked worrying for months, such as the fallout from the US housing slump and the crisis in the credit markets.
Equity markets' success in avoiding a sell-off for so long is more surprising than their recent and sudden capitulation.
The lessons from history are not encouraging.
However, popular indicators of sentiment had already turned so bearish by the end of last week that they signalled an imminent bounce.
But that has not happened.
Further, the market's fascination with falls of 10 and 20 per cent can be misleading.
Since 1970, when either index has fallen more than 15 per cent from a high it has not staged a recovery until the sell-off has turned into a true bear market.
Once sell-offs go this far, history says they can be expected to fall further before hitting a bottom.
How is Didi Chuxing likely to spend the $1bn investment from Apple?
Didi says it will be invested in products and new technology.
But some experts say it will be needed to fuel its battle with US-based Uber for market share in China.
China's car-hailing wars have seen both sides spend billions of dollars funding discounts for customers and subsidies to drivers.
In March Didi's chairman, Cheng Wei, told the website QQ Tech that the company had set aside $4bn raised since last year to spend on what he called "market fostering".
It was not clear how much of it had already been spent, though estimates based on a financial presentation made last year suggest Didi could have lost $1.4bn last year mainly on subsidies.
Uber lost $1bn last year in China according to chief executive Travis Kalanick.
"Didi cannot afford to lower subsidies or that will just be surrendering its users to competitors."
Didi will not disclose its financial losses but a spokeswoman said it was spending less on subsidies than Uber and was breaking even in more than half of the 400 cities it operates in.
"Investors wouldn't have shown such support had we not shown them a clear path towards profitability," she said.
Apple has lost more than 40 per cent of its share of the Chinese tablet market over the past year to cheaper rivals led by Samsung Electronics, as devices based on Google's Android and other operating systems rapidly overtake the US company's gadgets.
Samsung shipped 571,000, or 11 per cent of the total, in the second quarter of this year.
The data echo statistics showing Apple is losing ground in the tablet market worldwide.
While iPad shipments globally dropped 14.1 per cent year-on-year in the June quarter, shipments in China continued to grow but not as fast as competitors', rising 28 per cent compared with the same period last year, IDC said.
That compared with triple-digit growth for other leading brands in the Chinese market.
?Android players are growing with strong price advantage," said IDC analyst Dickie Chang. "Samsung, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer are providing more competitive products with [countrywide reach]. Meanwhile, consumers are familiar with Android OS from smartphone use."
A principal factor in the rise of Android tablets has been the falling price of components.
That has enabled lower-cost Chinese brands to make their presence felt in the tablet market.
The average per-piece price of the touch panels used in 7-inch tablets fell 7.5 per cent to $15.60 between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, according to supply chain analysts at IHS.
The funds will continue to hold US Treasuries in the event of a downgrade or default but they are building up liquidity and shunning certain securities due to fears that a failure to raise the debt ceiling could trigger client redemptions.
Government-only money market funds have boosted the amount of cash available to meet redemptions within one week to 68 per cent of assets, from 48 per cent at the end of March, according to Barclays Capital.
"We've built up liquidity with a rather meaningful amount of maturities prior to the debt ceiling", said Robert Brown, head of Fidelity's money market business.
Banks are also holding more cash and US corporations are postponing decisions due to uncertainty about where to invest cash amid fears that a failure to raise the debt ceiling would trigger a credit rating downgrade and possible default.
Money market funds are avoiding the one-month treasury notes which mature on August 4 and August 11.
"Those are the securities most vulnerable to some sort of change", said Joseph Abate, strategist at Barclays Capital.
The interest rates offered by the two one-month debt securities are more than twice the rate for lending the government money on a three-month note maturing in September.
Money market funds, which hold $338bn of US government debt according to Citigroup, are also reducing the amount of time they are willing to lend, which could raise funding concerns for banks, as they are reliant on short-term borrowing in the repurchase, or repo market.
A day after president Barack Obama urged lawmakers to come up with a "fair compromise" in the next few days, there was no immediate sign of progress.
Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House of Representatives are formulating separate plans to raise the national debt limit.
Shanghai is leading a race to host the headquarters of a new "Brics" development bank that will challenge for the first time the US postwar dominance of multilateral lending institutions, people familiar with the matter in Bras  lia and Washington said.
The bank, to be controlled by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is expected to start with capital of $50bn and to be officially launched by the Brics heads of state at a summit in Brazil on July 15.
The new bank, which will be the first bricks-and-mortar institution to be set up by the Brics economies, will initially be too small to rival the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund in terms of size and importance.
But it will serve as a reminder to US policy makers of the need to reform these institutions to better reflect the shift in the global economy towards the developing world. Shanghai is leading a race to host the headquarters of a new "Brics" development bank that will challenge for the first time the US postwar dominance of multilateral lending institutions, people familiar with the matter in Bras  lia and Washington said. The bank, to be controlled by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is expected to start with capital of $50bn and to be officially launched by the Brics heads of state at a summit in Brazil on July 15. "From this next summit, the Brics will be identified with a bank and with a contingent reserves arrangement which are in the process of being approved," said Jos   Alfredo Graa Lima of Brazil's external relations ministry.
The establishment of the Brics bank comes as China leads the charge for a separate multilateral institution in Asia to rival the Asian Development Bank, which Beijing fears is, along with the World Bank, overly influenced by the US and its allies.
Last month it proposed doubling the size of registered capital for the bank, which would be called the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to $100bn, compared with the ADB's $165bn, the FT reported last week.
Under the plan, four of the Brics     China, Russia, India and South Africa     are suggesting cities to host the headquarters of the new institution.
The issue is expected to be decided at the leaders' summit but Shanghai is seen by analysts as the favourite.
Each of the Brics will contribute an initial $10bn to the new bank, whose name has yet to be decided, of which part will be paid in immediately and the rest will be callable capital     available only if needed to meet the bank's obligations.
The World Bank had capital as of June last year of $223bn, most of it callable.
Membership by other countries will be considered at a later stage but the Brics will remain in control of the majority of the shares.
The leadership of the bank is likely to be rotated every five years with the first president of the institution to be decided by the heads of state in July.

China's largest commercial bank grew rapidly in the Middle East last year, as trade links between the Gulf and the world's second-largest economy flourished.
Lending, deposits and profits at the Middle East arm of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China all more than doubled in 2011, the bank announced yesterday, amid booming demand for trade financing between the two regions.
As Chinese links to the Middle East grew, "we have been able to provide our clients with a trade and investment bridge", says Tian Zhiping, chief executive of ICBC's Middle East business.
The world's largest bank by market capitalisation launched its Middle East unit in 2008, as the global financial crisis hit the Gulf.
Despite subdued corporate activity and economic uncertainty in the region, the unit's assets have grown 38-fold in the three years since, reaching $3.06bn by the end of last year     a 146 per cent rise over 2010.
Lending grew at a similar clip, with the balance of loans and advances up 148 per cent to $2.63bn.
Trade financing continues to represent the bulk of ICBC's regional business, but the bank's renminbi-denominated services are seeing growing demand, as Gulf states and their lenders looked to deepen their exposure to the Chinese currency.
"We see trade finance continuing to be one of the biggest growth areas for our business," says Mr Zhiping.
But in expanding into other services, he says, "our rapidly growing renminbi business will enable us expand our investment banking and advisory businesses".
Wall Street executives, in a private meeting with a top Federal Reserve official in late September, recommended a coordinated effort by central banks to remedy the European financial crisis, according to Fed documents received in an open-records request. The meeting, led by Louis Bacon, founder of hedge fund Moore Capital Management, preceded a joint action Wednesday by the world's major central banks, which banded together to provide liquidity to the markets through cheap U.S. dollar loans.
The Sept. 27 meeting with Mr. Dudley exemplifies the private meetings some Wall Street investors have with top Fed officials, in which they can gain access to potential early clues about Fed actions.
Hedge funds have been pushing to get more information about the inner workings of the Fed, according to people familiar with the situation, as detailed in a Wall Street Journal page-one article Nov. 23.
The Fed's meetings with investors present a delicate situation for U.S. officials.
The Fed's Mr. Dudley declined to comment.
In a statement, Mr. Bacon defended the meetings, saying, The Fed and Treasury canvass market opinions extensively through a variety of private-sector committees, contacts and trading desks in their task to fund the nation's exploding debt load, stabilize markets and optimize economic outcomes.
Members of the Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets include some of the biggest names on Wall Street, including Keith Anderson of Soros Fund Management; Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co.; Peter Fisher of BlackRock Inc.; Joshua Harris of Apollo Management LP; Alan Howard of Brevan Howard Asset Management; Deryck Maughan, a former chief executive of Salomon Brothers who now is at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.; and David Tepper of Appaloosa Management LP.
Minutes of the meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal include notes taken by Fed staff members   but no record of comments by Mr. Dudley or any Fed officials at the meeting.
Mr. Dudley previously has said in a statement that he is in listening mode  during the meetings and that he is careful not to provide insights into our thinking  during meetings with investors.
He also said it is important the Fed understand investors' thinking during periods of stress and that he filters out investors' suggestions on policy that reflect their own interests.
Committee members have said the questions asked by the Fed in advance of the meeting can give clues to the Fed's thinking.
The bulk of the three-hour meeting with Mr. Dudley on Sept. 27 at the New York Fed headquarters addressed the fallout from the financial crisis in Europe.
Mr. Bacon, who was asked by Fed staff members to lead the discussion, began by saying he felt a Greek default was likely  and he believed there was a sizable risk of an accelerated Greek bank run,  according to meeting minutes.
The group suggested a number of ways to address the European crisis, including coordinated credit easing and/or quantitative easing by  the European Central Bank.
The group also urged central bank guarantees of sovereign debt,  investments in European sovereigns and banks,  implementation of capital controls' and government guarantee of bank funding and/or depositors,  as well as recapitalization of the IMF,  according to the minutes.
A draft agenda in advance of the September meeting included questions about U.S. fiscal and monetary policy as well as the crisis in Europe, according to the Fed documents.
Following the call, the agenda items relating to Europe expanded, according to the records.
Among the questions of the final agenda: What steps should policy-makers consider to cushion any adverse market and economic impacts in Europe and elsewhere of a credit event?
Mr. Bacon has been asked to speak about Europe during meetings with the Fed a number of times.
I was wondering if you would consider leading off the discussion on Europe, as you did at a meeting last year,  the official said in the email.
Mr. Bacon responded the same day in an email, saying: Ok, I will take it on. All Europe, all the time   getting weary.
The South Korean company shipped 10.3 million smartphones during the period, more than double the 4.9 million a year earlier, according to data from Strategy Analytics.
Though LG showed signs of breaking away from its close competitors by snagging the No. 3 spot for the first time, holding on could prove to be a tough goal.
LG's world-wide market share rose to 4.9% in the first quarter from 3.2% a year earlier. China's Huawei Technologies Co. followed closely with 4.8%, while ZTE Corp. came in fifth with a 4.3% market share.
There has been no clear no.3 player in the market,  Mark Newman, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note Monday.
The South Korean company's Optimus line of smartphones covers a broad price range from premium to low-end segments.
LG is set to expand the number of its retail stores in emerging markets.
Still, in China, the world's largest smartphone market, local players like Huawei and ZTE have a competitive edge.
We acknowledge [LG's] strong recovery in handsets, but remain cautious on the sustainability of this ,  Mr. Newman wrote in his report.
The task he set his son was to sell off DRG, a UK stationery company whose brands included Sellotape and Basildon Bond, piece by piece.
Two years and 12 deals later, he sold the last chunk.
As a reward, Sir Roland offered him an open credit line at a rate of 10 per cent.
However, the process, complicated by recession, had been gruelling and controversial     not to mention disappointing financially     and Mr Franklin returned to America determined to invert the model his father and Goldsmith had perfected.
"Breaking up a business is very anti- establishment. It's the equivalent of short selling a stock today     nobody is rooting for you. I decided I wanted to build something instead."
In the ensuing years, Mr Franklin, now 50, has gone a long way to delivering on this ambition, following the sort of corporate trajectory he had been raised to disdain.
Jarden, the consumer products company he has built up, sells products as diverse as coffee grinders, kitchen jars, mops, fire alarms, babies' dummies, tents, fishing rods and candles.
Its most familiar wares include Breville sandwich toasters, Rawlings baseball mitts and K2 skis.
The roots of Jarden are in Alltrista, the maker of Ball preserving jars.
Mr Franklin took the helm of Alltrista in 2001, having built and sold businesses in the eyewear and eyecare sector.
He had initially amassed a 9.9 per cent stake in Alltrista before demanding board seats and being installed as chief executive.
"I took an activist position, or at least you'd call it that today, but it was no different to what my father and Jimmy were doing 30 years before. The difference was that I didn't want to buy the company and break it up."
Mr Franklin is far from being as much of a household name as some of Jarden's brands, however, which appears to suit him, given that he professes to dislike publicity, partly because of negative press attention he received during the dismantling of DRG.
When we meet in a sleepy hotel on the New York-Connecticut border, it is without minders or entourage.
He speaks economically: his brands are not synergistically complementary verticals, they are just "good".
Some of his media profile thus far has been related to his running exploits: not jogging but ultra-marathons that can stretch out for more than 100 miles.
"Endurance sports are a release: they give me time to think," says Mr Franklin. "Some of my best ideas have been when I'm running...I also wanted to show my kids that daddy can suffer and that daddy doesn't always win and that life is tough."
It is also important, he says, that as the purveyor of a large number of sporting goods, he does not come across as a "cigar-chomping chief exec".
Discussion of exercise raises the inevitable question about his relationship with the disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong.
I ask him if he sees any reputational risk in associating
with him. "I think he's in an environment where a lot of people he competed with were, shall we say, on a level playing field and was still the most successful. But I wasn't there so cannot...
At this moment, his phone rings and the conversation stops.
When he finishes, he asks: "Where were we?" I say he was saying something too diplomatic about Mr Armstrong.
"Yeah. Look, I would never put myself in a position knowingly where I would ever have to apologise for my own conduct in business, ever. He did. I wasn't there; I can't judge.
Mr Franklin has recently expanded his interests into speciality chemicals     a shell company he launched 18 months ago has closed or is closing a trio of deals worth $6.7bn.
But whether he is buying crop sprays or snowboard manufacturers, the deals are guided by the same basic idea that a good brand can stand alone in the wider company irrespective of what else that company sells.
It is a philosophy that runs counter to the current mode for streamlining businesses, epitomised by Procter & Gamble's recently announced plans to cull up to 100 of its consumer brands.
"I think [P&G's] challenge is they're trying to do the soupe du jour for Wall Street; not always a good strategy. There is an obsession with streamlining businesses at the moment, which basically means lay-offs.
In the store, a female shopper scans Mr Franklin for a few seconds before approaching.
"Excuse me, but aren't you..." She gets stuck on the name, and punts: "David Martin?"
He politely answers in the negative before turning back to browse racks of the brightly coloured gilets, reassured that it is his brands that America's consumers recognise instead.
Eurozone bond markets suffered a mass sell-off on Tuesday as investor fears spread beyond Italy and Spain to triple A rated France, Austria, Finland and the Netherlands.
The premium that France and Austria pay over Germany to borrow rose to euro-era records of 192 basis points and 184bp respectively, levels investors say are no longer consistent with top credit ratings.
"Markets are losing patience so they are going for the jugular, which is the core countries and not the periphery," said Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes, the UK fund manager. "There is convergence but it is convergence on the weakest."
Mike Riddell of M&G, one of Europe's biggest fund managers, called it "probably the most worrying day" of the crisis so far.
The rise in bond yields affected all main eurozone countries apart from Germany, and suggests that the two-year-old sovereign debt saga could be entering a dangerous phase.
The Spanish premium to Germany hit 482bp, above the critical 450bp rate at which Irish and Portuguese yields spiralled out of control and forced both countries into international bail-outs.
Belgium also saw its bonds' spread over German debt reach record levels of 314bp.
Traders said there were few buyers in many bond markets, with only the European Central Bank active in Italy and Spain.
"It is really scary," said one at a US bank. "Everyone is liquidating in the eurozone bond markets ... Everyone is heading for the door."
German benchmark 10-year yields fell slightly to 1.77 per cent.
Finnish and Dutch yields rose 17bp and 10bp, leaving their premiums to Germany close to their 2009 euro-era peaks.
A Chinese property group is in advanced talks to buy Sunseeker, Britain's largest luxury yachtmaker by sales, underscoring the growing appetite for European luxury assets among Chinese buyers.
Dalian Wanda, which is based in Beijing, is expected to pay about    300m for Sunseeker if a deal is agreed, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The transaction is likely to be finalised before the end of this month.
The acquisition of the yachtmaker, which is based in Poole, Dorset, highlights the growing number of Chinese companies trying to acquire top-end brands and technology in Europe to satisfy domestic hunger for western luxury and fashion.
Mr Wang is a well-known fan of Sunseeker yachts.
In 2010, his group purchased a rocket-shaped Sunseeker Predator 108 Special Edition, which is used by the villain in the James Bond movie Casino Royale.
Sunseeker boats generally feature large cabins, convertible sunroofs and spa tubs.
He said regulatory approval from both Britain and China had been obtained.
London-based private equity group Candover had acquired Ferretti in a    1.7bn leveraged buyout in 2006.
Chinese groups are also eyeing industrial companies and technologies in Europe.
Last year, Shandong bought a stake in Kion, a German forklift maker owned by New York private equity group KKR.
If the Sunseeker deal goes ahead, Dalian Wanda is expected to keep all the manufacturing and design operations in Poole, protecting the jobs of the 2,500 people the yachtmaker employs in the area.
FL Partners, the Irish private equity owner of Sunseeker, began holding talks with Wanda late last year.
The firm took over the yachtmaker in 2010 through a debt restructuring after the company slumped to a loss the year before.

The slump marks the unraveling of a practice that boosted profits for several years at warehouse operators including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and Glencore Xstrata PLC .
Bank warehousing practices now are the subject of investigations by several U.S. authorities, including a Senate panel.
The reversal underscores Wall Street's efforts to wring profits out of power plants, oil pipelines and metals warehouses.
After spending billions of dollars in a decadeslong expansion into all corners of the raw-materials business, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.  and Morgan Stanley  are trying to sell commodities assets.
The game as we know it seems to be over,  said James Malick, a partner in the capital markets practice at Boston Consulting Group. It's hard to see anything new that is bolder, bigger or better  in commodities.
In warehousing's heyday, the firms offered aluminum producers cash, rent discounts and other incentives to put metal into storage rather than selling to users such as brewers and soft-drink makers, according to analysts and traders.
Meanwhile, the prolonged time in inventory generated hefty rental income for warehouse owners that more than made up for the incentives paid out.
Industrial aluminum users such as Coca-Cola Co. and aluminum-sheet maker Novelis Inc. have complained to the London Metal Exchange that warehouses had artificially slowed the release of aluminum, limiting supply and driving up prices.
A MillerCoors LLC executive testified in a Senate banking committee hearing last month that the practices were inflating consumer prices by billions of dollars.
Glencore, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan declined to comment.
Average daily aluminum shipments to LME warehouses were down 79% in the first 19 days of August from two months earlier, according to data provided by New York-based metals consulting firm CPM Group Inc. August's daily average rate of aluminum deliveries is the lowest since November 2011, CPM Group said.
At the same time, the cash incentives dangled before producers by the banks and trading firms that own the facilities recently have dropped to $50 a metric ton from more than $200 this past spring, traders said.
As more metal comes back into the market, the premium charges for immediate delivery have fallen 7.2% from their record in July, according to Platts.
On Tuesday, LME aluminum for three-month delivery closed at $1,914.50 a metric ton, down 7.6% this year.
Spurring the bank pullback: A decline in commodity profits amid more-placid markets that have limited trading opportunities and increased capital requirements that have made running these businesses more expensive.
Commodity revenue at the 10 largest global investment banks in 2012 fell 57%, to $6 billion, compared with 2008, according to Coalition, a research consultant.
Raw-materials trading in 2008 generated as much as a third of revenue within large banks' market-making business, which matches buyers and sellers in the fixed income, currency and commodities markets; it now accounts for less than 7%.
As things stand right now it's a very, very bleak picture,  said Paul Johny, research director of Coalition.
Employment in commodity divisions at the 10 largest global investment banks dropped to 2,183 at the end of the first quarter from its peak of 2,775 at the end of 2010, according to Coalition.
J.P. Morgan plans to sell physical assets such as warehouses and power plants.
The Wall Street bank has told potential buyers of its commodities assets that it expects to kick off sale efforts in early September, said people familiar with the sale process.
Metro operates 29 of 37 LME-licensed warehouses there.
UBS AG  last year closed all of its commodity trading desks not tied to precious metals such as gold and silver.
The Wall Street securities firm doesn't disclose specific results for the commodities unit, but people familiar with its performance said revenue has fallen to less than $1 billion last year from nearly $3 billion five years ago.
The firm sought to sell its commodities business last year, but talks broke down after the sovereign-wealth fund of Qatar said it wanted only certain parts of the business, principally oil, according to people briefed on the talks.
The sides discussed different structures for a partnership to run the business together but couldn't reach an agreement, the people said.
Not for the first time this year, the behaviour of the Chinese renminbi is causing more than the odd furrowed brow in the markets
"If this continued [this will] undermine the People's Bank's case that the currency is being kept basically stable'," says Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, who says the Chinese authorities have "mismanaged" the renminbi since first announcing the basket in December.
"December's oblique statement that they were managing [the renminbi] against the basket was one of the triggers of the [global market] panic. So they responded by locking down volatility against the dollar, the opposite to what the statement had suggested," Mr Williams says.
He believes the People's Bank has taken advantage of a period of broad dollar weakness to let the renminbi slide, a move that has gone little noticed with most attention still focused on the bilateral rate against the dollar.
Robert Minikin, head of Asia FX strategy at Standard Chartered, believes at least part of the weakening of the renminbi on a trade-weighted basis is "tactical", given that the dollar might be expected to strengthen anew if and when the US Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates again.
Mr Minikin's view stems from his perception that China is in reality steering a "middle path" between maintaining a stable trade-weighted rate and a stable rate against the dollar.
"When you get big moves in the dollar's value, they are reflecting that in some way in the [renminbi's] fix, but not in a way to completely prevent it feeding through into [the trade-weighted] value," he says.
"I think it's still in transition, the idea that they have jumped directly to manage against the basket hasn't been borne out by these moves," says Mr Minikin, who believes this period of transition could last for several years given the wider world's continuing obsession with the bilateral dollar rate.
In reality, the Chinese authorities have always said that while they want the renminbi to be broadly stable against the basket, this does not entail a hard and fast peg.
Instead, movements are supposed to reflect "the dynamic of market supply and demand" in the "real economy" .
"Don't think they are going to micromanage [the renminbi's rate]. They will keep us guessing a bit and that's what you have to do in financial markets," Mr Bloom says.
The 100-mark is the level the renminbi closed at on December 31 2014, when the International Monetary Fund thought it was about fair value in trade-weighted terms.
However, given the uncertainty the renminbi's ructions cause for markets worldwide, he argues there is merit in Beijing adopting a more explicit FX regime to avoid any misunderstandings.
Known primarily for its e-commerce heft in China, Alibaba is redesigning its business for the mobile Internet era by stepping up investment in its own smartphone operating system.
Its $586 million investment in Sina Corp.s  Twitter-like Weibo microblog business on Monday followed an earlier move this month to promote its mobile platform.
A tighter grip over Sina Weibo, which has 46.2 million daily active users, could enable Alibaba, whose Taobao shopping site has more than 500 million registered users, to have access to vast swaths of data.
And having control over the operating system is the best way to gain access to all the mobile-based data, Mr. Zeng said.
Data on mobile phones are so valuable,  he said.
While Alibaba makes money through advertisement and service fees, how to monetize data accumulated through its online services--be it on PCs or mobile--has been a challenge.
The fledgling Alibaba Mobile OS, or AMOS, faces an uphill battle against Android, which, according to research firm IDC, powered more than 80% of all smartphones shipped in China last year.
Apple's iOS held around 10%.
Alibaba is aiming for a 10% share, even though its current market share is less than 1%, Mr. Zeng said.
In September, Google objected to Acer Inc.s  plan to sell a smartphone powered by Alibaba's OS.
As Acer is part of the Google-led Open Handset Alliance, the U.S. firm said that the Taiwanese computer maker couldn't work with a noncompatible  version of Android.
Alibaba rejected the view that its OS was an Android fork, but the Acer phone was never released.
If quite a few handset companies decide to choose Alibaba's OS, Google will have to be careful in how far they want to push it,  even if the handset makers belong to the Open Handset Alliance, said Mr. Zeng.
Google declined to comment.
Alibaba, founded in 1999, initially became known for its Alibaba.com business-to-business site connecting Chinese suppliers with buyers, but it has since expanded with websites for consumers.
Taobao is an eBay-like marketplace for small merchants, while Tmall hosts online storefronts for retailers including brands such as Gap Inc. .
Weibo could bring a boost to Alibaba's mobile-based businesses,  said Canalys analyst Rachel Lashford.
The deeper the cooperation, the bigger the benefits.
One factor that could work in Alibaba's favor: In China, Google faces challenges due to Beijing's restrictions, despite growth in some of its online advertising services.
The company has pulled out its search service out of mainland China disagreements over censorship.
In March, a Chinese government research institute accused Google of using Android's dominance to discriminate against local companies.
Google declined to comment on the accusation.
Given the restrictions on Android's services in China, Alibaba could make its OS more competitive by seamlessly integrating Weibo's service and also taking advantage of its Alipay affiliate's expertise in mobile payment, said Ms. Lashford.
You have to compete differently in the mobile space, rather than simply leveraging your strength in the PC-based market,  Mr. Zeng said.
Fears that speculative inflows of "hot money" could destabilise the Chinese economy have long pre-occupied policymakers in Beijing.
Now that the renminbi has been cut loose from its peg to the US dollar, these worries are back with a vengeance.
The problem for policymakers is that most investors believe that the renminbi is significantly undervalued against the dollar     some even estimate by almost as much as 50 per cent.
So speculating on a revaluation is widely seen as a one-way bet.
Speculative inflows surged during this period as investors bet on further renminbi appreciation.
This saw China's currency reserves rise by $1,100bn as it stemmed the renminbi's rise, compared with an increase of just $500bn in the previous three years when the currency was pegged to the dollar.
"Currency reserves shot up, compounding China's problem of how to diversify its assets. They will want to avoid that problem this time."
The message: speculators could get burned.
"The PBoC is trying to make the point that there is two-way risk     this is not just a one-way bet," said Robert Reilly, co-head of Asian fixed income and currencies at Soci  t   G  n  rale.
While the renminbi was allowed to rise 0.42 per cent against the dollar on Monday     the biggest move in 18 months     traders got a shock yesterday when it retreated 0.2 per cent.
The talk in the market was that Chinese state-owned banks were aggressively driving down the price of the renminbi under orders from the central bank.
"The greater flexibility     or two-way volatility between the renminbi and the dollar     will help mitigate hot money inflows," said Jun Ma, China economist at Deutsche Bank.
Mr Ma expects that there will be greater volatility in the exchange rate than there was between mid-2005 and July 2008, when the renminbi rose more than 20 per cent against the dollar.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Chinese policymakers have been telling domestic banks that they must be on their guard to prevent clients from sending money in and out of the country to fund illicit speculation.
Two weeks ago, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange , which manages the country's $2,400bn in foreign exchange reserves, summoned senior bankers to discuss the renminbi forwards market.
But the regulator stopped short of introducing controls on renminbi forward transactions     unlike South Korea, which imposed restrictions on forwards transactions this month to reduce volatility in the won.
But economists reckon the chances of a big move are slim.
The consensus expects a shallow, gradual appreciation.
Three-month non-deliverable forwards currently imply a rise of just 0.77 per cent in the renminbi against the dollar, while one-year forwards suggest the market is expecting a rise of just 2.39 per cent.
In the past, rising expectations for renminbi appreciation in the forwards market have tended to coincide with hot money inflows.
One reason given is that the annualised rate of appreciation is too slim to attract those investors who are unable to take on leverage.
Another big disincentive for hot money is that there are widespread fears that the Chinese economy is starting to cool and that the property market is about to crash.
"Hot money inflows are not driven just by currency appreciation expectations, but also by expectations on asset prices," said Qu Hongbin, HSBC's head of Asian economics research.
The Shanghai stock market has already tumbled more than 20 per cent this year, while housing sales are dropping sharply in many cities following a government clampdown on property speculation.
In some respects, an increase in hot money inflows into China would provide a welcome boost to domestic liquidity, reckons Michael Kurtz, China strategist at Macquarie.
"It may perversely help stabilise, or even lift, China's sagging domestic real estate and equity markets," Mr Kurtz said.
That would trigger severe outflows, economists say.
And while inflows are relatively easy to manage through conventional policy tools such as open market operations or changes to the reserve requirement ratio, sudden outflows would be more problematic, Mr Kurtz said.
Carlyle Group LP's flagship local-currency fund in China, set up with the Beijing city government, is close to finalizing its first investment, said Carlyle co-founder David Rubenstein, who remains bullish on China despite two investments that recently have soured.
It's hard to know what additional steps might have been taken, but obviously something could have been done better,  said Mr. Rubenstein when asked about China Agritech Inc. and China Forestry Holdings Co., two companies in which Carlyle has invested and which recently had serious questions raised about their accounting.
The former chief executive of Hong Kong-listed China Forestry was arrested by Chinese authorities in February on allegations he embezzled 30 million yuan.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Stock Market has moved to delist China Agritech after the company dumped Ernst & Young Hua Ming as its auditor when the Chinese branch of the U.S. audit firm balked at signing off on the company's books.
Agritech has appealed the Nasdaq's delisting move and its shares have been suspended. When you're in the private-equity investing world, everything doesn't work every time,  Mr. Rubenstein said.
A number of Chinese firms that are listed in the U.S., Singapore and Hong Kong have drawn allegations from investors and regulators in recent months that they have distorted their earnings and the true nature of their operations.
That has raised questions about the quality of corporate governance in China and the extent to which investors are properly informed about the firms in which they have invested.
With $3 billion invested by Carlyle in about 50 Chinese firms, Mr. Rubenstein played down the significance of the problems at the two firms.
Our experience in China couldn't be better,  he said.
Mr. Rubenstein said Carlyle has recently opened an office in the western city of Chengdu to better access opportunities away from the traditional private-equity stomping grounds along China's coastal regions.
Mr. Rubenstein said the joint-venture fund Carlyle set up with the Beijing city government   one of two yuan-denominated funds Carlyle set up last year   has reached an agreement  on its first deal.
He said the company is in the retail sector but declined say more.
Its other fund, a Shanghai-based joint venture with Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group, is looking at deals' but hasn't made any investments yet, he said.
Traditionally, foreign private-equity funds have invested in China with money raised from overseas.
But increasingly they are looking inward, where there is no shortage of domestic investors looking for alternatives to the stock and property markets to put their money.
Moreover, funds denominated in yuan have a broader range of local investment opportunities than their foreign-currency counterparts.
Foreign funds have recently been setting up their own yuan funds.
U.S.-based TPG launched funds of five billion yuan each in Shanghai and Chongqing last year.
Carlyle's Beijing fund has already raised $500 million worth of yuan from local Chinese investors including Beijing-based pension funds.
The fund hopes to raise upward of $750 million in total.
The fact that we could raise as much as we've raised for our [yuan] fund is really testament to the fact that Beijing is our partner,  Mr. Rubenstein said. If Beijing had not been our partner we couldn't have raised the amount of money we've raised today.
Carlyle acquired its China Forestry stake in two transactions beginning in January 2008, paying US$55 million for what now amounts to nearly 11% of the company.
According to preliminary figures from Harvard's admissions department, about 25% of the 919 students in the class of 2013 are from finance industries -- including private equity, banking and venture capital -- compared with 32% last year.
Harvard administrators say the change reflects a greater quantity of strong applicants from nonfinance industries.
Students with manufacturing backgrounds make up 14% of the class of 2013, up from 9% the previous year.
Technology rose three percentage points to 9%.
Though the school continually seeks to bring in a diverse mix of students, We don't run with quotas or targets,  says Deirdre Leopold, managing director of M.B.A. admissions and financial aid. We drive towards what they can contribute to the overall learning.
But some M.B.A. admissions consultants say they've seen finance-industry clients rejected who would have been admitted in other years.
When they sought reasons from Harvard, they were told it was because their backgrounds were in finance or consulting, rather manufacturing or technology, he says.
Some applicants to Harvard likely will try to adjust their applications to fit what they see as Harvard's desires, says Jeremy Shinewald, founder of mbaMission Inc., an admissions consulting firm.
You're going to see guys who worked on one private-equity deal with an auto manufacturer try to play up their auto experience and look ridiculous,  he says.
About 39% of Harvard's class of 2013 will be female, its highest percentage ever, Ms. Leopold says.
Wen Jiabao, China's premier, has given his most optimistic assessment of the Chinese economy since the start of the year, saying that it had stabilised and that the government's target of 7.5 per cent annual growth was well within reach.
Mr Wen's comments, published in a statement on the government's main website on Wednesday, came a day before China publishes its third-quarter GDP data.
The data are widely expected to show growth slowing from the 7.6 per cent recorded in the second quarter and marking the country's seventh straight quarterly slowdown.
Before previous data releases this year Mr Wen warned that the Chinese economy faced "downward pressure" because of the lingering impact of the global financial crisis.
But in the comments released on Wednesday he struck a more upbeat tone: "The economy in the third quarter was quite good. We can now say with confidence that the growth of the Chinese economy is basically stabilising . As policies are implemented and hit their mark, the Chinese economy will stabilise further."
He added that he was sure the economy would achieve the government's full-year target of 7.5 per cent growth.
Analysts from investment banks to the World Bank have downgraded their forecasts for Chinese growth in recent months, though most still see it clearing the 7.5 per cent mark.
China will begin a once-in-a-decade leadership transition in November, leaving Mr Wen with a little less than five months left in his premiership.
He has faced sharp criticism domestically for failing to move the economy away from its reliance on investment, bequeathing an unbalanced growth model to his successors that analysts warn could result in a crisis.
But in the comments released on Wednesday Mr Wen defended his record: "We have taken new steps towards structural transformation," he said.
He singled out the steel sector and called for stronger efforts to eliminate overcapacity.
Mr Wen had made his remarks during a series of meetings with officials, industry executives and economists between October 12-15.
The government has been working to cool the property market, blocking people from buying second homes, and Mr Wen vowed that these policies would continue.
Reviewing the economy's performance in the third quarter, Mr Wen said that there had been a series of positive developments, particularly since the start of September.
Chinese exports rose 9.9 per cent year-on-year in September, while inflation dipped to 1.9 per cent, well down from last year's peak of 6.5 per cent.
The government has steadfastly refused to launch a large stimulus programme like it did in late 2008, but it has unveiled a series of smaller investment plans and also loosened the reins on bank lending.
A series of analysts said this week that the Chinese economy appeared to be close to bottoming out.
"Economic activity could be on a recovery path going into the fourth quarter on improved financing and increased infrastructure investment," Ha Jiming, a strategist with Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sent waves of erroneous orders into the stock-options market on Tuesday morning, the latest technical glitch to roil market prices and bedevil traders and regulators.
The orders, placed for options on stocks and exchange-traded funds with ticker symbols beginning with the letters I through K, drove some prices sharply lower.
U.S. options exchanges notified traders on Tuesday that officials were reviewing the trades and might cancel some.
Still, Goldman's potential losses on the mishap could run into hundreds of millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter.
The exchanges are working to resolve the issue,  a Goldman spokesman said in a statement. Neither the risk nor the potential loss is material to the financial condition of the firm.
The trading error highlights the mounting risks of global financial markets that increasingly are being driven by computers rather than people.
A series of mishaps since the flash crash  of 2010, which sent stocks and exchange-traded funds plummeting in minutes, have undermined confidence in market systems around the world.
The system mistakenly issued orders based on that data, but at a default price that in some cases was far below market rates.
Goldman fixed the issue and is studying what went wrong, one person said.
People familiar with the matter said Goldman's total losses could range from several million dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending on how many trades the exchanges allow to stand.
Firms also can reach deals with counterparties on errant trades that reduce their potential losses.
In its notice, NYSE officials said they anticipate that most of the impacted trades will be busted,  or canceled.
The episode is the latest in a series of market mishaps arising from technology designed to make markets more efficient. The CBOE suffered a system outage on April 25 that forced it to delay the open of trading for more than three hours.
In February 2012, a rogue trading program flooded the U.S. options market with about 30,000 erroneous trades, requiring exchange officials to cancel some transactions and adjust others.
Nasdaq's problems during the May 2012 initial public offering of Facebook Inc. FB +1.59% contributed to an estimated $500 million in losses for Wall Street firms trying to buy and sell the stock.
Earlier in 2012, electronic-exchange operator BATS Global Markets Inc. canceled its own IPO after a software bug forced the exchange to suspend trading in the shares.
Knight Capital Group Inc. KCG +1.47% suffered a $461.1 million loss after faulty trading software left the firm holding about $7 billion in stocks after less than an hour of trading.
The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday to pass legislation targeting China's management of its currency, the yuan, underscoring U.S. frustration with one of its largest trading partners.
Although the bill is unlikely to become law, the Senate debate has kept a public focus on the currency issue as the two countries remain at odds over China's control of the yuan.
In recent days, the Chinese central bank has intervened in currency markets to drive up the value of the yuan against the dollar, a development in line with U.S. goals.
A bipartisan group of 63 lawmakers voted in favor of legislation intended to force the White House to be more aggressive in seeking tariffs and other penalties against countries with misaligned  currencies, while 35 lawmakers opposed it.
The bill is aimed at helping U.S. firms, which argue that Beijing's policy of holding down the value of the yuan benefits China's exporters by acting as a trade subsidy.
Majority Leader John Boehner  has called the approach dangerous,  and has insisted he will resist pressure for a House vote.
That may be the best outcome for the Obama administration.
White House officials have opposed action by Congress in the past while trying to leverage the threat of congressional action to press China for a faster rate of currency appreciation.
President Barack Obama weighed in on the issue last week when he accused China of manipulating the yuan and gaming the trading system to its advantage.
But he also expressed concern about how the Senate bill might affect U.S. international obligations.
Chinese officials have objected to the Senate effort.
But China supporters say it is unlikely that Beijing will take concrete action against the U.S. unless the bill is enacted.
Chinese officials have reached a consensus that 6% or so in annual yuan appreciation is enough to help fight domestic inflation and, eventually, lift the currency to a point where it could float freely.
Mr. Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner have said that pace isn't adequate.
But given the expected change in leadership in Beijing next year, U.S. officials acknowledge privately that politicians are unlikely to make a substantial change to the speed.
The Senate's vote on the bill highlights the role China could play in the 2012 elections.
Some lawmakers have seized on the country as a reason the U.S. has a faltering economic recovery, a central point in current political debate.
Business organizations such as the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the bill could spur trade disputes that would hurt U.S. interests.
Sen. Joe Lieberman  said Tuesday he worried about the countries engaging in a mutually damaging trade war.
The latest data from the government were mildly encouraging: Retail sales increased 0.4% in August from the prior month after increasing 0.3% in July, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, in a sign that consumer spending is growing at a sustainable clip.
Weak consumer spending and stubbornly high unemployment have hobbled the recovery, and prompted fears in some quarters that the U.S. could slip back toward recession.
But those fears have eased recently as the U.S. has notched several better-than-expected economic reports.
The central bank is considering whether to restart the bond-buying it undertook last year and early this year to drive-down long-term interest rates and encourage more private borrowing and, thus, economic growth.
It has already pushed short-term interest rates to near zero, but growth remains stubbornly slow, unemployment high and inflation lower than the Fed wants.
Right now the Fed is holding its bond portfolio at a constant level.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has avoided laying out specifically what would prompt him to grow that portfolio by restarting the bond-buying program.
Other members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee have differing views.
Tuesday's retail sales numbers suggested the consumer sector is holding up, though not growing briskly.
Thanks in part to back-to-school shopping, consumers doled out more money at clothing stores, where sales climbed 1.2% in August.
But shoppers have been made hesitant by high unemployment and falling home prices.
This hit big-ticket items in August.
Sales at auto dealers, furniture stores, and electronic and appliance retailers fell.
Mr. Bernanke has laid out broad markers for his threshold to further Fed action but has been vague to avoid getting ahead of the brewing debate. The Fed would be proactive in addressing significant further disinflation,  he said in an August speech, suggesting the threat of an inflation slowdown could spur him to act.
He added the Fed wanted to avoid a further significant weakening in the economic outlook,  suggesting more subpar growth could be another trigger.
Global banks can no longer assume access to the Federal Reserve's discount lending window as an element of their living wills, people familiar with the process have warned.
Hundreds of banks took advantage of the discount lending window on many occasions during the 2008 crisis.
They added that the prohibition defeats the purpose of the discount window and the Fed's role as the lender of last resort.
"How are you supposed to write these living wills if the assumptions regulators are making are false and inaccurate?" asked one US analyst. "They are disconnected from what would happen in the real world."
But the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which are under pressure to avoid government bailouts in any future crisis, want the banks to come up with emergency plans that do not involve government aid, even when it comes to the discount window, which is available only to banks that are in trouble rather than failing.
For the 2013 living wills, 11 banks, ranging from Citigroup to Barclays, were told they had made unrealistic assumptions about how customers, counterparties and investors would behave in a crisis.
In addition, they were informed that they had failed to identify the kinds of structural change that would be needed to ensure an orderly resolution.
Officials have said the living wills are a learning process and more leeway was given to banks for the 2012 process.
Having already submitted living wills for this year before receiving the response to their 2013 plans, banks have to show improvements in their 2015 plans or risk facing financial penalties.
The Fed and the FDIC were split on their responses to the living wills this month.
The FDIC took the more severe stance of deeming the plans "not credible", which paves the way for potentially punitive action.
The Fed stopped short of that, saying instead that the banks had to immediately rectify "shortcomings".
Misaligned exchange rates are more often than not a prelude to trade friction.
Buy America provisions and bail-outs for bankrupt motor companies are less damag- ing than trade barriers of the kind erected by the Smoot-Hawley Act in the 1930s.
Until August 2007, liberalisation in global banking enhanced the efficiency of the financial system and facilitated trade in goods and services along with cross-border movements of capital.
The huge advantage of such globalisation was that lenders no longer needed to be physically close to borrowers.
The impact has been quite as severe as any controls over imports, although a return of financial stability would mitigate the damage.
Capital and financial flows tend to display a homing instinct in a crisis.
And this is now being reinforced by the regulatory response to the financial debacle.
Home countries, Iceland being the most obvious case in point, may not be able to honour obligations to depositors abroad if their banks are too big for their economies.
There are plenty of countries that potentially fall into this category.
New York-based econo- mist Geoffrey Bell points out, for example, that Ireland's bank liabilities are 954 per cent of GDP, while Switzerland's are 644 per cent, which has led to suggestions that UBS and Credit Suisse should be forced to shrink.
By threatening to curtail cross- border capital movements, such regulation will shrink trade in goods and services and thus moderate growth and development.
Reducing institutions' international reach will, says the BIS, come at the expense of economies of scale and scope.
So a safer and more stable financial system may be a less efficient one.
Excess savings in Asia, northern Europe and the petro-economies are deflationary.
In response to the global recession, the excess savers have loosened fiscal policy.
But in Germany's case this has been done with extreme reluctance.
Japan has been more willing, but its public sector debt burden is such that it will probably want to tighten relatively soon.
The counterpart of a surplus of savings over investment is a current account surplus.
It follows that the excess savers continue to expect others, and the US in particular, to provide a dumping ground for their exports.
But why should the US do this at the cost of another debt binge and subsequent crash?
Why, Americans will ask, should they burden their children with huge debts just to generate jobs in Germany, Japan and China?
The only positive gloss that can be put on this is that it may take a dose of protectionism to shock the excess savers into structural change.
But that smacks of burning down the house to roast the pig.
Sampling foreign foods is a highlight of many tourist itineraries but a particular group of rich Indians take a different approach to eating overseas; they bring along their own chefs.
The Marwari people, from the desert state of Rajasthan, are strict vegetarians known in India for their adherence to traditional Hindu customs and for their wealth -- often from trading.
Their chefs are known as maharaj, or little kings, because of their importance in the Marwari household, and Marwaris are also gaining renown in India and elsewhere for taking these chefs with them wherever they go.
In one notable example last month, Mumbai-based billionaire Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who made his fortune trading on the stock market, flew out to Mauritius his eight chefs to cater for his 50th birthday celebration.
The chefs cordoned off a section of the InterContinental Mauritius kitchen to prepare the vegetable dishes, dals, or lentils, masala tea, and sweets.
They even brought their own spices,  said the hotel's manager Raju Gandi. No one is more particular about eating their own food than the Indians and the Chinese.
A growing number of Indians are holidaying abroad -- 10.8 million of them vacationed overseas last year, up almost 10% from the previous year, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
It's not uncommon for them to prefer to eat home-cooked food when overseas, packing away a paratha, or flat bread, and pickles, or even their own stove on which to cook lentils and rice, while traveling.
We are pretty orthodox when it comes to food,  said Gayatri Ruia, a real-estate executive from Mumbai. Our food is a way of life and we are creatures of habit. When cost is no consideration, it makes sense to take your own cook so you can be sure of enjoying the food you love.
Marwaris will not eat food that has been prepared in kitchens where meat, poultry, fish or eggs have also been present.
They cook food that is fiery and distinctive, and features lots of dried vegetables, beans and hard desert berries, with buttermilk used instead of water.
Many wealthy Marwaris guard their maharaj closely, and chefs often pass on their skills to their own children, so that several generations of maharaj can end up working for generations of the same Marwari family.
Many Indians, including Marwaris, are also taking their chefs with them when they go overseas to celebrate special family occasions such as weddings, anniversaries and birthdays -- a trend that has accelerated in recent years.
Mahesh Prasad, a 48-year-old maharaj, has worked for New Delhi home-furnishings exporter Puja Jain for 25 years.
His father was chef for the Jains for 40 years before retiring.
Ms. Jain and her parents, Manju and Dharam Prakash Kothari, always take their cooks and foodstuffs with them because they don't trust the provenance of any food except what is made in their home.
That means traveling not just with the chef but also the dry ingredients, spices and even the cooking oil.
When Ms. Jain and 70 of her family rang in the New Year in Dubai this year, Mr. Prasad and his two junior chefs were there to cook dinner or traditional Marwari thali -- a mix of lentil and vegetable dishes, plus rice, chapattis, pickles, yoghurt, chutneys, salad and poppadum.
You'll never see a Marwari traveling without spices, pickles and the savoury snacks that we must have at tea time,  said Ms. Jain. It's basically about comfort. Everything about a holiday is new -- the place, culture and language -- so it's nice to have the comfort of familiar food.
China's foreign exchange regulator has uncovered $10bn in fake cross-border trade since April last year and has turned 15 cases over to police in a crackdown aimed at curbing hot money flows.
Speculators have long used inflated trade invoices as a means to skirt China's strict capital controls and convert foreign currency into renminbi, aiming to profit from currency appreciation and higher interest rates.
China's currency is freely convertible for foreign trade and other current account transactions but there are tight restrictions on investment flows.
For the past decade, speculators aiming to circumvent these capital controls have overstated the value of export invoices, allowing them to disguise speculative capital as income from the sale of goods and services.
Banks that buy and sell foreign exchange to clients are supposed to verify the authenticity of trade documents but enforcement is often lax.
Speculators typically use hard-to-value items such as electronic circuits as the basis for their invoices, making it tricky to detect inflated shipment values.
"Many firms used forged or altered trade documents, or reused property documents to conduct fake trade," Wu Ruilin, deputy head of Safe's inspection department, said at a press conference in Beijing, according to a transcript.
"They used re-exporting as a tool for speculation and arbitrage, even turning it into a channel for cross-border flows of hot money and criminal funds," Mr Wu said, referring to the practice of exporting a shipment of goods and then reimporting it, often through a neighbouring port.
The difference between the reported value of the two shipments constitutes an illicit fund flow.
Safe has periodically cracked down on hot money flows over the past decade when hot money inflows have threatened to disrupt the central bank's efforts to control the money supply and contain property or other asset bubbles.
Investors' appetite to bring hot money into China appears to have waned this year, however, as economic growth has slowed and renminbi appreciation appears less of a sure bet than in the past.
Safe said it was increasing its use of "data analysis" through its electronic forex monitoring to uncover cases of apparent fraud.
Anyone with an equity fund that tracks the S&P 500 has something close to 10 per cent of their investment in commodities companies, such as oil and gas producers or the miners of metals and minerals.
For anyone who owns the FTSE 100, the figure is more than 20 per cent, largely because BP and Shell dominate the UK stock market.
Yet an increasing number of financial advisers suggest that investors should also carve out an additional piece of their portfolio to invest directly in commodities.
The advice is controversial but for many people who are considering moving beyond a "plain vanilla" portfolio of stocks and bonds, commodities will be an obvious option to consider.
The list of tradeable commodities literally runs from A to Z, from aluminium to zinc.
Crude oil and natural gas are among the most important to the global economy, but energy investors can also pick propane or ethanol or heating oil.
Agricultural staples include corn and coffee and cocoa, among many more.
And there are a good half-dozen industrial metals to trade, and precious ones, too, including the speculator's favourite: gold.
Just about the only characteristic in common across this diverse list is volatility.
Commodities do not pay dividends or generate earnings like company shares and they do not promise to pay interest like a bond.
Without these anchors, their price swings wildly in response to changing assumptions about supply and demand.
Political developments are far from the only things an investor has to monitor.
Changing global trade patterns, currency fluctuations, recessions, wars, even the weather, whose occasional droughts and deluges can ruin an entire year's agricultural crop     any of these could send prices soaring or crashing.
Counterintuitively, despite all that volatility, adding commodities to a portfolio may help an investor sleep at night.
That, at least, is the theory espoused by financial advisers who recommend a 5 or 10 per cent allocation to the asset class.
The traditional way for individuals to invest was to set up a brokerage account and to venture into the futures markets.
This is still the spiciest way to trade today; the leverage built into these derivatives contracts means that one can make big money from relatively small changes in a commodity's price, but brokers can also demand large sums of money to cover potential losses and bad bets can go very sour, very quickly.
The ETF.com database shows 149 such funds in the US alone, ranging from single-commodity funds like the SPDR Gold ETF to the popular PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund, which mimics the price movement of a broad basket of commodities.
Be wary of some pitfalls, however.
Actively managed mutual funds are a popular alternative, and Pimco and Fidelity are among the industry titans with commodities offerings.
Investors will find that professionally managed, diversified funds inevitably come with higher fees.
Such is humankind's historic attachment to gold, its fans argue, it can be counted on to retain its value even while currencies decline and empires fall.
Certainly it remains a go-to investment in a financial crisis, and investors who see inflation around the corner will always consider gold a hedge against the declining real value of other assets.
The two largest commodities ETFs are both gold funds, and no other investment arouses such passionate debate, but the precious metal's price remains as slippery as any other commodity.
Gold     indeed like all commodities     belongs in the category of speculative trades rather than long-term investments.
Big Ben went small.
And that is probably a good thing.
Rather than come in guns blazing in the wake of Monday's market rout, the Federal Reserve chose at its Tuesday meeting to hold off on extreme measures, notably the resumption of purchases of government bonds that some investors had hoped for.
Instead, Chairman Ben Bernanke and the Fed opted only to change language for how long it expects to keep interest rates near zero until at least mid-2013'; previously, the Fed only said rates would be kept low for an extended period.
As unprecedented as this was, it still fell short of what some in markets expected.
Not that it immediately mattered -- stocks soared.
This is especially the case given three Fed members dissented from the statement because they thought the extended period  language shouldn't have been changed.
Moving too fast also holds other risks.
A quick reversal on asset purchases would have looked schizophrenic given that just two months ago it opted to let its previous, $600 billion bond-buying program expire as planned.
It also isn't clear how much impact additional bond buying would have on the economy and job growth.
Even if the last bond-buying program helped -- an issue still the subject of much debate -- the Fed risks getting less and less bang for its buck.
Plus, banks aren't in the kind of dire straits that necessitate central-bank action.
The financial system is awash in liquidity and credit markets are functioning.
Perhaps the biggest reason for the Fed to hold back: By not riding to the markets' rescue, it may put more pressure on politicians in Washington.
Just as markets have become overly reliant on the Fed, Washington also has become too confident that even if it dithers, Bernanke & Co. will do the heavy lifting.
After all, as Mr. Bernanke has repeatedly said, the Fed can only do so much.
True, the Fed isn't likely to stand by if deflation again becomes a threat.
But for now, the Fed is right to let markets find their own footing and demand the government does its part to shore up the economy.
At a dramatic press conference relayed live on television, he proclaimed victory in his tussle with General Electric, titan of US industrial capitalism, over the terms of its takeover of much of the energy group Alstom, symbol of French engineering prowess.
"It is a victory for Alstom, a success for France and undeniably a political success for the return in force of the state in the economy," Mr Montebourg said.
For him, the key condition of the deal was for the state to become Alstom's biggest shareholder, acquiring a 20 per cent stake.
That will make the French government GE's main partner in the three areas where GE and Alstom will have 50:50 joint ventures     in power grid operations, renewables and nuclear turbines, with the state holding an additional "golden share" in the latter.
But for Mr Montebourg and the government, an important and longstanding principle of French industrial policy has been upheld: the central role of the state.
There were differences within the government over the Alstom case.
Until the last, Mr Montebourg's preference was for a rival bid he solicited from Siemens.
the German group, which ultimately joined forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to propose a deal similar in structure to that eventually struck with GE.
Mr Hollande was careful to remain neutral, his team clearly mindful of GE's long record as a good corporate citizen in France.
But there were no arguments over the necessity to step in when news of Alstom's original plan to make a clean sale of its energy business to GE leaked in April. "It was perfectly natural for the government to intervene," said a senior presidential aide, citing the strategic nature of Alstom's operations, particularly in nuclear power. "Such a deal would have been impossible for a French company in the US," he added.
The stage is set for a showdown Friday morning over control of a Lower Manhattan park, as Occupy Wall Street protesters vowed to resist efforts by the city and the site's landlord to remove them to clean the area.
Protesters issued calls on Twitter for supporters to begin arriving at midnight to Zuccotti Park to marshal a resistance, setting up a possible confrontation with the landlord, Brookfield Office Properties Inc., and New York City police in front of a huge media audience.
Some said they would link arms and refuse to leave as the cleaning crews arrived at 7 a.m.
Brookfield and the city say the privately owned park has become unsanitary after nearly four weeks of occupation by hundreds of anti-corporate protesters.
Mr. Kelly said the demonstrators would be allowed to return after the cleaning but can't bring beds, tarps and other prohibited items   terms the protesters said would effectively end their occupation.
We won't allow [Mayor Michael] Bloomberg and the NYPD to foreclose our occupation,  said Occupy Wall Street spokesman Patrick Bruner in a statement. This is an occupation, not a permitted picnic.
Friday morning's interaction with the demonstrators poses thorny issues for Brookfield and the police.
The landlord has repeatedly asked the NYPD to intervene, but Mr. Kelly said Thursday the park's regulations must be enforced by Brookfield.
This is private property,  he said. Any control of that property in terms of directing people to adhere to the regulations that they put in place, will be done by Brookfield personnel.
Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the stakes for all sides were high.
You could have a 79-year-old grandmother there who could end up dead before that's all over, through nobody's fault, just because you've got hundreds of people on one side and hundreds of people on the other side,  said Mr. O'Donnell, though he doubted the confrontation would happen because there was too much risk for all involved
If the protesters are seen as being violent or provocative or disregard public safety and public order, I think they could end up with a serious problem,  Mr. O'Donnell said.
The European Central Bank responded Thursday to pressure for radical action to stop the rot in the euro zone's financial markets, but stopped well short of giving any commitment to increased purchases of government bonds.
ECB spelled out a raft of measures to help ease pressure on banks, but none to bail out its debt-laden governments, with ECB President Mario Draghi repeating earlier messages that the bank's program of government debt purchases is neither infinite nor eternal.
Mr. Draghi was also decidedly cool on the prospect of lending money to the International Monetary Fund, in order to let it lend back to troubled euro-zone governments, although he didn't categorically rule out the possibility that national central banks in the EU, rather than the ECB itself, could supply the funds.
Euro-zone officials on Thursday said the EU is nearing a deal to lend    200 billion  to the IMF   including    150 billion from the 17-nation currency bloc   that the IMF could then use to shore up the troubled euro-zone sovereign-debt market.
EU leaders were to make final decisions on the proposal at their summit meeting starting Thursday as part of a larger deal they hope will prevent a collapse of the euro zone.
The    150 billion will come from bilateral loans from the euro zone's central banks to the IMF, while an additional    50 billion in loans would come from noneuro-zone EU countries, an EU diplomat said.
Bond purchases and IMF-enhanced support had been talked up as having potentially the biggest impact in restoring confidence to battered markets, and financial markets reacted with acute disappointment.
Italian 10-year bond yields, having fallen as low as 5.94%, shot back up to 6.25% in later trading.
The euro, meanwhile, fell nearly two cents against the dollar during Mr. Draghi's news conference, to $1.3328, close to its intraday low.
Mr. Draghi said he was puzzled  by the reaction to his comments.
We have our own views, we have collaborated in the process, but the responsibility is with the leaders,  he said.
Mr. Draghi announced the new measures after the bank decided to cut its benchmark rate as expected, by a quarter point, returning it to a record low of 1%.
The bank now expects inflation to average around 2% next year and 1.5% in 2013, and has lowered its growth forecasts.
A decade ago, when Alan Greenspan was chairman of the mighty Federal Reserve, he was infamous for delivering ambiguous, Delphic speeches that nobody could understand.
No longer.
These days the retired Greenspan speaks so clearly that some of his words are still ricocheting around the blogosphere.
For what he revealed on the CFR platform was that he harbours considerable doubts about whether recent western monetary policy experiments have actually helped economic growth.
He also fears that such experiments have been so wild that it will be very hard to exit from these policies in the future     in the US or anywhere else     without sparking huge market volatility.
Indeed, Greenspan is so worried about future turbulence that he apparently sympathises with investors  who are currently stocking up on gold.
"Why do central banks put money into an asset which has no rate of return, but [has] cost of storage and insurance and everything else like that? Why are they doing that?" he asked rhetorically     before offering his own explanation. "Gold is a currency. It is still, by all evidence, a premier currency.
Now, by many standards, this is a remarkable comment.
In his youth Greenspan was fascinated by gold .
So it is striking     if not counter-intuitive     that he now considers gold a viable currency, let alone an attractive investment bet.
This is a bit like a  turkey giving a treatise on the value of Christmas.
Unsurprisingly, Greenspan's comments have sparked considerable scorn from some of his former and current colleagues in the western central bank world.
But though Greenspan's comments might make other central bankers wince, it would be foolish to ignore them.
Take a look, for example, at Switzerland.
But recent polls indicate almost half the population supports the idea, suggesting it could possibly be passed.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the recent midterm elections have strengthened the Republican party and cast a new spotlight on key figures such as Rand Paul, the Republican senator.
Why?
As Greenspan himself points out, the sheer scale of recent monetary policy experiments has raised concerns about a future outbreak of inflation .
But there is a third, more subtle psychological issue as well.
Most ordinary people have no idea what central banks are really doing, with their trillion-dollar experiments.
They are unnerved about how money works in a bottomless cyber space.
But the beauty of gold is that it seems tangible, clear and finite.
It also seems timeless, creating an impression of permanent, intrinsic value.
Its value, like that of fiat currency, depends on social convention.
Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, has vowed to overhaul state-dominated financial institutions, liberalise interest rates and eventually make the renminbi freely convertible in a sweeping restatement of the newly installed government's economic reform agenda.
He said his government intended to take "gradual and active steps towards market-based interest rates and the exchange rate of the renminbi," and "gradually achieve full convertibility of the renminbi under the capital account".
He also signalled Beijing's intention to allow greater opening of the country's burgeoning financial sector, which remains dominated by state-owned behemoths.
The government "will reform financial institutions of various ownerships     in particular we need to further ease market access to open up a broader space for financial institutions of various ownerships to develop their businesses," Mr Li said.
His repeated use of the term "various ownerships", a catch-all phrase used to refer to private and foreign ownership, will give hope to international financial institutions, which face tough restrictions in China and occupy only a tiny slice of the market.
Although liberalisation of interest rates and renminbi convertibility are already stated policy objectives of the government, Mr Li has rarely laid out Beijing's financial reform agenda with much detail.
Mr Li did not provide a timetable or any specifics on the government's planned reforms but in the coded language of China's communist leaders his speech indicated the importance the administration places on reforming a financial sector weighed down by masses of debt.
Since the 2008 global financial crisis China's financial system has flooded the economy with credit, creating asset bubbles and overcapacity and potentially an enormous stock of future loan defaults.
Of particular concern has been the enormous borrowing by local governments across the country, many of which appear unable to repay their debts.
"Regarding the local government debt issue, which has become a source of concern, we are taking pertinent measures to regulate and address it in an orderly fashion," he said. "Here, I can say with certainty that the situation is on the whole safe and manageable."
The government recently commissioned a national audit of all local government debt in order to get a more accurate picture of the size of the problem and many economists and even some officials have said the problem is probably much larger than Beijing has admitted.
"China is now at such a crucial stage that without structural transformation and upgrading we will not be able to achieve sustained economic growth," he said. "In readjusting the structure, the most important aspect is to expand domestic demand."
Wireless-operator Sprint Nextel Corp., pork-producer Smithfield Foods Inc. and now whiskey-maker Beam Inc. are falling into Asian hands.
Such multibillion-dollar purchases of U.S. companies by Asian corporations hadn't been seen since before the 2008-'09 financial crisis, when drug maker Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. was purchased by Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
But the past year's deals have been bigger than ever, and the targets are well-known U.S. brands.
And unlike a spate of purchases in the 1980s, when Japanese electronics company Sony Corp. took on Hollywood by purchasing Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., Asian buyers have avoided touchy areas and thus, a backlash from American consumers.
We have not seen such a strong phenomenon of Asian firms buying U.S. brands before. I believe we will see more multibillion-dollar outbound M&As by Asian companies this year,  said Lian Lian, a co-head of North Asia mergers and acquisitions at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
The sluggishness of the global economic recovery may encourage Western firms to rationalize value expectations' and sell assets, she said.
Japan's Suntory Holdings Ltd. said Monday it would buy Beam for $13.6 billion -- less than a year after SoftBank Corp. purchased Sprint for $21.6 billion.
The deals are part of a drive by Japanese companies -- struggling with an aging population and slow growth at home -- to strengthen their offerings and boost their popularity overseas.
In the SoftBank deal, Sprint received cash to help it compete with bigger rivals in the U.S., one of the world's most lucrative markets for smartphones.
In some ways, Suntory going for Beam is not a surprise,  said Jeremy Cunnington, an analyst at Euromonitor International in London. The company, along with its fellow Japanese companies, has been looking to diversify away from its moribund markets. And undoubtedly, Beam's array of international brands would make it a truly global spirits player.
The deal will vault Suntory to the world's sixth-largest spirits company by volume from 25th, Mr. Cunnington said.
While Japanese companies have been pushing to gain access to overseas markets, their Chinese counterparts have been making purchases to bring brands home.
Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. last year bought Smithfield Foods for $4.7 billion, the largest purchase by a Chinese company of a U.S. one.
Shuanghui's purchase gave it a well-respected brand that Shuanghui can take home to China -- the world's largest pork consumer -- as food scandals and increasing urbanization drive demand for a safe, secure food supply.
Shuanghui's deal stood in contrast to a 2005 attempt by oil company Cnooc Ltd. to buy Unocal Corp. for $18.5 billion, which was thwarted by fears for U.S. national security.
Asian companies bought $260 billion in U.S. assets in the five years since 2009, above the $206 billion purchased in the previous five years, according to Dealogic.
The SoftBank and Suntory acquisitions are bigger than the Asian -- primarily Japanese -- acquisitions of U.S. assets made in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Excluding financial services, the next-biggest Asian purchase of a U.S. company was Takeda's $8.1 billion purchase of Millennium in 2008, trailed by Japan Tobacco Inc.s $7.8 billion purchase in 1999 of the international tobacco operations of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
The SoftBank deal still would be the biggest after adjusting for inflation.
Once again, word has emerged of another potentially serious bidder for BlackBerry. Once again, shareholders were hardly impressed.
Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group has signed a non-disclosure agreement that allows it to look at BlackBerry's books, a signal it is actively exploring a bid.
BlackBerry shares remain nearly 10% below the preliminary offer from Fairfax Financial, BlackBerry's biggest holder.
Why have reports of interested parties failed to spark a rally in BlackBerry's shares?
In the case Lenovo one of its hurdles is the fact it's Chinese.
Canadian officials have made no secret of the fact that a foreign buyer would be closely examined before being allowed to purchase a home-grown giant like BlackBerry.
Earlier this year, amid speculation Lenovo was interested, Christian Paradis, then Canada's industry minister, said it was premature to speculate how the government would rule , but that each deal was viewed on a case-by-case basis.
We hope to see RIM remain a global leader and player, and make sure it can grow organically,  he also told Reuters.
The threat of a review was reiterated last month again by Mr. Harper, who told CNBC that all deals in the technology space would be reviewed on national security grounds.
The U.S. would also have to approve the deal.
The willingness to let that deal pass increased some hopes other Chinese buyers could enter Canada.
Millions of school leavers and graduates with fairly useless' degrees are unemployable because they lack basic skills, a major business lobby group will warn today.
The devastating report, from the British Chambers of Commerce, reveals small businesses are frustrated at the quality of applicants, who they say can barely concentrate or add up.
Nearly half of the 2,000 firms surveyed said they would be fairly or very nervous' about hiring someone who has just finished their A-levels.
The group questioned the owners of micro-businesses', those with fewer than ten employees. Many have vacancies which they are desperate to fill but were scathing about the quality of candidates.
The report states: In general, younger people lack numerical skills, research skills, ability to focus and read, plus written English.
One unnamed entrepreneur told researchers: Plenty of unemployed, mostly without experience in my sector. The interpersonal skills of some interviewed in the past have been very poor.
Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the fault lies with the education system, not with the young people themselves.
He said new courses spring up because there is demand from would-be students     but not necessarily from businesses.
Dr Marshall said: There may be a course in underwater basket weaving, but that does not mean anybody will actually want to employ you at the end of it.
He cited the American television crime drama CSI as a prime example.
It sparked a huge growth in the popularity of forensic science courses, but Dr Marshall said demand for these graduates is low.
Dr Marshall said he is desperate for the country to listen to business and create the right courses to fit the jobs that are available.
He said three big economic issues ought to be on the table whenPresident Barack Obama and China's Xi Jinping meet next week in California.
China's trade surplus with the rest of the world, measured as a share of its economy, has come down in recent years.
That's partly because its big customers the U.S. and Europe haven't been buying as much as they once did and partly because China has allowed its currency to gently climb, which makes its exports less attractive.
Or, as Mr. Summers put it in econo-speak, it's important for China and the U.S. to avoid "a rewidening of imbalances on a large scale as the two economies evolve, which I think would be quite unfortunate for both U.S. economic performance and the global trading system."
There are, Mr. Summers said, "a range of Chinese business practices that are unacceptable in terms of what they mean for the competitive position of foreign firms."
These, of course, range from stealing American intellectual property to barring foreign investments from huge swatches of the big Chinese economy and are a persistent annoyance to U.S. companies in China.
Asked about the standards the U.S. should use in deciding which Chinese investments the U.S. should accept, Mr. Summers said U.S. government scrutiny is warranted when the Chinese seek to invest "where the industry involved has substantial national security sensitivity in the form of possessing technological knowledge of a kind that is not otherwise available, and it could be used in ways that are adverse to our national security, or where the industry is sufficiently central to networks that a decision by those who control it could have substantial adverse impacts on the U.S. economy."
The world has changed.
The international financial institutions haven't changed enough in response, Mr. Summers once chief economist at the World Bank suggested.
Is there going to be a global system?
What is the role of the International Monetary Fund?
He didn't offer any answer to those questions.
"No one can forecast with confidence the future of the Chinese economy," he said.
"In retrospect, U.S. alarmism about Japanese growth peaked at just about the same point that the Japanese competitive threat to the American economy peaked.
And not very long after those concerns, Japanese economic weakness became more of a concern for the United States than Japanese economic strength.
"I think that U.S. policy makers would do well to recognize that there's an enormous range of uncertainty about possible Chinese outcomes and that sustained, rapid growth and greater competitive threat is one of the possibilities, but it is by no means the only possibility," he said.
Amazon is upping its game in the color tablet market.
Now, Amazon has come up with a successor, the Kindle Fire HD, which comes in two screen sizes, 7 inches and 8.9 inches .
Again, I see the key advantages of these new Fires as low base prices and easy access to Amazon's content offerings.
The 7-inch model, while beefed up, still starts at $199 and the larger version at $299.
By contrast, the latest iPad starts at $499, though the older iPad 2 is still available at $399.
But this time, Amazon is facing a well-received, 7-inch, $199 competitor: Google's Nexus 7, which also is positioned as primarily a front end to an online content store.
So, while Amazon is still stressing that these new Fires are best seen as front doors to its online stores, it is now claiming the Fire HD is also the best tablet at any price.
For starters, its base model has 16 gigabytes of storage, double that of the original Fire or the base Nexus 7, and equal to the base iPad.
It is slimmer, lighter and more stylish than its predecessor.
The Fire HD isn't as polished, fluid or versatile as the iPad.
It offers only a fraction of the third-party apps available on either the iPad or the Nexus 7 .
I found that after prolonged use, the Fire HD showed signs of latency -- apps and content displayed delays in launching.
You have to pay Amazon another $15, using an obscure setting on a Web page, to escape these ads. And there are pitches to buy more content on many other screens, even those displaying your already-purchased content.
The main user interface has changed.
Instead of a series of faux shelves displaying recently used apps and content, there is now a carousel, a scrolling horizontal array of these items.
It also is about the same thickness as the Nexus, though a bit heavier.
It is much lighter than the larger iPad, but about 10% thicker.
I found its speakers far better than those on the iPad and Nexus. Like the original Fire, the Fire HD is technically an Android tablet.
It uses last year's version of Android, Google's mobile operating system, while the Nexus uses a newer, more polished version.
But, like its predecessor, the new Fire buries Android, demoting it to mere plumbing.
Instead of the standard Google Play store for apps and content, it has its own.
Most Android apps aren't available there.
The Kindle Fire is a service,  he said.
For instance, iPad owners can get free apps from Amazon for Kindle books, Amazon video and music.
But this content, and especially the ability to quickly buy it, is much better integrated into the Fire.
The Fire has some content capabilities that aren't present in Amazon's iPad apps.
Among these are the ability to lend certain books; a feature called Immersion Reading,  which lets you listen to a professional audio narration of a book  as you read along; and a feature called X-Ray,  which quickly displays all the characters in a book or all the actors in a movie.
But in my tests, I couldn't replicate that.
Most Web pages I tried loaded slightly faster on the iPad.
And, using two different speed test utilities on two different networks, I found the iPad was a bit faster in almost every instance, occasionally much faster.
It lacks artificial-intelligence features like Apple's Siri, or Google Now, a feature of the Nexus 7.
Amazon's app store has about 30,000 apps, versus more than 500,000 for the iPad or Nexus.
In my harsh battery test, where I set the screen at 75% brightness, leave on the Wi-Fi to collect email in the background, and play videos back to back, the Fire HD was respectable, if not up to its claim of 11 hours, or as good as its competitors. It lasted nine hours and 28 minutes, compared with just five hours and 47 minutes for the original Fire.
That was about half an hour less than the iPad, but over an hour less than the Nexus.
Overall, I see the 7-inch Fire HD as a good value for those primarily interested in easily tapping Amazon's large collection of content.
A new estimate of the economic damage wrought by the Japan disaster put the figure as high as $300 billion, while insurers continued to offer early estimates of their exposure.
Analysts expect about 10% to 20% of the economic cost of the earthquake to be borne by private insurers and reinsurers, most of which have enough capital to withstand the losses.
Still, with economic losses potentially exceeding $200 billion, the event would still be one of the costliest disasters in history for the insurance industry. Swiss Re said Monday it expects claims costs of $1.2 billion from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but cautioned that its estimate is subject to a higher-than-usual degree of uncertainty and may need to be adjusted as the extent of the insured losses becomes clearer.
The reinsurance company said the incident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is unlikely to result in a significant direct loss for the non-life insurance industry.
American International Group Inc. last Friday estimated its property and casualty business would have to pay $700 million in claims arising from the Japan earthquake and tsunami, excluding $500 million in catastrophe reserves its Japanese operations earlier established for earthquake damage to people's homes.
Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company by premiums, and Hannover Re both said on Monday that it was too early to provide an estimate.
French reinsurer Scor SE has said its pretax losses will likely be less than 185 million .
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which has an agreement to assume a 20% share of Swiss Re's world-wide property and casualty business, is likely to face claims from the Japanese quake.
The Omaha, Neb., conglomerate so far hasn't provided estimates of its quake-related claims but is expected to disclose them when it reports first-quarter results.
Analysts from Barclays Capital said Berkshire is likely to see a $1 billion to $2 billion impact, a loss the cash-rich company can easily absorb.
The World Bank warned this week that Japan's disaster could cause exports from developing nations in East Asia to slow by as much as 1.5% as manufacturers in those countries suffer from supply-chain disruptions.
Korean firms are facing higher prices for memory chips and exporters of cars in Thailand say current supplies of components imported from Japan will last through April, the World Bank said.
General Motors Co.s South Korean unit said Monday that it will reduce production to prepare for a possible shortage of key components, following a similar decision by Renault SA's Korean subsidiary.
In addition, one-fourth of the region's long-term debt is denominated in yen, and appreciation of the yen increases the cost of servicing that debt, the World Bank report said.
On a brighter note for the insurance industry, the events in Japan may mark a turning point for reinsurers, which for several years have suffered from declining prices for the cover they provide.
This event could stabilize reinsurance pricing in the months ahead as reinsurers' capital and capacity has been reduced by a string of catastrophic events during the past six months,  said ratings firm Moody's Investors Service in a recent report.
Moody's anticipates strong reinsurance-market conditions in Japan for renewals at the start of April, as well as in Australia and New Zealand, where renewals occur midyear.
The rater also said that share buybacks among global reinsurers, which were heavy during 2010, will grind to a virtual halt as companies preserve capital for the coming Atlantic hurricane season.
The metal used in wiring and power cables fell to its lowest level in five years in mid-January as demand in China weakened before the new year holiday and short sellers pushed down the metal.
That sentiment has temporarily eased over the past week after remarks from the Federal Reserve capped the dollar's dramatic rise and stocks in China traded near a seven-year high on expectations of government stimulus.
Copper for three months delivery rose 1.2 per cent to $6,119.5 on the London Metal Exchange.
In Shanghai, the most traded copper contract hit its highest level since early January.
Still, trade data released for February highlighted the weak demand for metals.
Total copper metal unit imports were at the weakest levels since July 2011, according to Jefferies.
"Copper consumers are nervous and unwilling to commit while traders don't want to hold too much material over fears that prices could drop further," said Gayle Berry, an analyst at Jefferies.
Copper's fate this year is likely to hinge on the state of China's property market and investment in power lines by state-owned State Grid.
On the supply side, the market is expected to be balanced, according to analysts.
For the price to rise further, there would need to be seasonal improvement in Chinese industrial demand, normally between February and May, says Tom Price, analyst at Morgan Stanley.
China's equity markets are notoriously volatile.
But in recent days they have been especially so.
After tumbling 4 per cent on Tuesday, Shanghai stocks are now down almost 9 per cent in the past three trading sessions.
Investors across the world are taking note.
"The key concern, and the reason the market sold off, is that inflation     particularly food inflation     is proving stronger than expectations. This is something that really worries Communist politicians," says Chris Ruffle, a fund manager at Martin Currie in Shanghai.
Data last week showed that consumer price inflation rose to 4.4 per cent in October from 3.6 per cent the month before     its highest level in more than two years and well above the government's target of 3 per cent.
While those levels are mild compared with the double-digit price rises of the 1980s and 1990s, there has been a disproportionate 10 per cent surge in food prices, which is hitting poor households especially hard.
The big question now is what the Communist Party will do to contain inflation and thereby suppress the risk of social unrest.
"The government's top priority has now switched from guaranteeing growth to controlling rising prices," says Arthur Kroeber of Dragonomics, a Beijing-based research boutique.
Beijing has already started tightening liquidity following last year's un-precedented government- directed lending spree that saw total new loans in the economy nearly double to Rmb9,600bn .
Officials last week increased commercial bank reserve requirements by 50 basis points and in October the People's Bank of China raised interest rates for the first time in more than two years.
These moves are only the beginning, says Mr Kroeber.
"Further tightening measures will be needed to keep inflation in check."
Yet many analysts and investors     including Mr Ruffle of Martin Currie     reckon that Shanghai's recent decline represents a buying opportunity rather than the start of a long-term bear market.
Indeed, equity valuations are not expensive by historical standards, with the Shanghai Composite trading at 16 times forecast earnings for the current financial year, according to Bloomberg data, or a 20 per cent discount to its average over the past five years.
"Valuations are still far from over-stretched levels seen in 2007 when rate hikes induced more profit taking," says Helen Zhu of Goldman Sachs.
But shares listed in Shenzhen, China's second stock exchange, are pricier.
Anthony Bolton, the star stockpicker at Fidelity International, says he remains bullish on Chinese stocks and describes China as "the investment opportunity of the next decade."
However, he adds that Chinese companies listed on offshore exchanges such as Hong Kong are generally trading at more attractive valuations than those in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Of course, Chinese equity prices have less to do with what investors believe are companies' fundamental valuations and more with speculation and the amount of money sloshing through the financial system.
As things stand, so-called "excess liquidity" remains abundant as the M2 measure of money supply is still growing at a faster pace than the economy.
At the same time, expectations that the renminbi, the Chinese currency, will appreciate against the US dollar in the coming months and years are fuelling big inflows of "hot money" into the country's asset markets.
China's foreign exchange reserves increased by $100bn in September     the largest ever monthly increase     although only $25bn of that inflow could be explained by the trade balance and foreign direct investment.
With the Federal Reserve pouring $600bn into the global financial system through a second round of quantitative easing and with US interest rates still close to zero, hot money inflows into China show little sign of stopping.
State media have reported that the authorities are considering the introduction of price controls in food and other commodity markets.
This would hit companies in those sectors hard, as their revenues would be limited at a time when wages and other costs are continuing to rise.
"Governments usually tend to adopt some form of price control measures when inflation becomes a social issue," says Vincent Chan at Credit Suisse, who reckons that sectors such as property, utilities and oil product refiners are most vulnerable.
The best performers will be companies with high fixed costs, strong pricing power, low leverage and low policy risk, he says.
The risk to this view is that inflation will prove more stubborn and dangerous than expected, prompting Beijing to unveil a sweeping move like aggressively cutting bank lending quotas.
If that were to happen, the shockwaves would ripple far beyond Shanghai.
Weakness in emerging market currencies is hurting global trade by reducing imports without any benefit to export volumes, according to Financial Times research on more than 100 countries. The findings suggest that any
currency war between developing nations is likely to be even more damaging than previously thought, leading to a reduction in global trade and possibly economic growth, rather than just reapportioning a fixed level of trade between "winners" and "losers".
The analysis coincides with concerns that some countries are engaging in competitive devaluations in order to undercut their neighbours and steal market share.
Since June 2014, the currencies of Russia, Colombia, Brazil, Turkey, Mexico and Chile have fallen between 20 per cent and 50 per cent against the dollar, while the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah are at their weakest since the Asian financial crisis of 1998.
China, which had held the renminbi firm against the dollar until this month, has since allowed it to fall 4.5 per cent, triggering a further wave of currency weakness across emerging markets.
The analysis found that having a weaker currency did not lead to any rise in export volumes.
However, it did lead to a fall in import volumes of about 0.5 per cent for every 1 per cent a currency depreciated against the dollar.
A fall in the value of a country's currency pushes up the price of imports, leading to lower demand for imported goods.
Top Chinese banks have halted most dealings with North Korea, an unprecedented move to use financial leverage against Pyongyang that reflects Beijing's exasperation with Kim Jong-eun's regime.
The financial blockade against North Korea goes beyond what Beijing had agreed to implement in UN resolutions, with several leading banks saying they had stopped all cross-border cash transfers, regardless of the nature of the business.
A UN resolution this year called only for sanctions in cases where money might contribute to North Korea's missile programmes.
Nevertheless, the blockade is not watertight.
A smaller bank based in northeast China said it was still handling large cross-border transfers, a sign Beijing is not cutting off North Korea.
Trade bet-ween the two has grown, providing a cash lifeline to the impoverished state.
But diplomatic ties have suffered.
Mr Kim has yet to visit China since taking power and has rebuffed Chinese entreaties to refrain from missile tests.
Concerned about the consequences for regional security, Beijing has started to usesanctions.
"We welcome these steps to protect the financial system from illicit North Korean activity," said a senior US Treasury official.
Bank of China, the country's primary institution for foreign exchange transactions, said last week it had closed the account of Foreign Trade Bank, North Ko-rea's main foreign exchange bank.
But asked whether it had also frozen other dealings with North Korea, the bank declined to comment.
Cai Jian, an expert on North Korea at Shanghai's Fudan university, said it appeared to be the first time that Chinese banks had taken such co-ordinated action against Pyongyang.
"Previously even when China signed on to sanctions against North Korea, there was still a lot of economic activity between our two countries," he said. "This time, I think, China's banks received orders from the government to cut ties."
Yet EM corporate credit has held up better than US high yield.
The fact that energy figures more prominently in EM corporate benchmarks makes this outperformance more intriguing.
Some argue that the relative resilience is explained simply by the fact that most EM corporate credit is investment grade.
However, ratings are not the assuring anchor they once were; our credit RiskMetrics suggest that EM ratings have only begun a process of being cut several notches.
The real reason EM corporates have been able to avoid serious stress is that about 35 per cent of outstanding paper is issued by partially or wholly government-owned companies.
In energy, a sector still under pressure despite the modest rebound in oil prices, the government ownership ratio is close to 70 per cent.
"The sovereign will not let the quasi-sovereign default" is a much too common refrain in EM investment circles and it is very likely correct.
But even as governments can delay the pain for some companies, their involvement also engineers a transmission of pain from credit to other assets.
In the US default rates in the energy sector are expected to rise to 11 per cent in 2016, a grim reflection of over-investment.
Default rates ex-energy and materials are below long-term averages.
Given the strong negative correlations between high yield spreads and government bond yields, one may argue that as energy companies confront stress, the cost of equity for a typical non-energy company falls.
Not so in EM.
As EM governments suppress corporate trouble, their own credit risk will probably rise, nudging their yields higher.
The cost of equity then rises for every company, even those that are fundamentally sound, in sectors unrelated to the one in trouble.
The accepted wisdom is that low public debt ratios compared with developed markets will enable EM governments to retain a very generous fiscal stance for a good while yet.
However, EM's weaker institutions, shallower markets and under-developed debt resolution mechanisms invalidate a like-for-like comparison with developed-economy public debt.
A link that reinforces the loop of trouble between EM corporates and sovereigns is the financial sector, which also happens to be the largest issuer of hard-currency debt in EM.
The non-performing loan cycle in EM has yet to manifest itself fully, even though debt service ratios for the private sector are higher than in developed markets.
That is because investors, both external and local, have been happy to roll over maturing debt until recently.
But rising leverage and a more elevated opportunity cost of global capital are whittling down investors' appetite at a time when EM refinancing needs are rising.
There are warning signs aplenty over in EM equities, which are less interested in a company's capacity to touch its parent for a quick penny and more focused on its ability to generate profits.
It is a damning statement on EM corporate management that the return on equity has fallen even though leverage has gone up. State-owned enterprises have been centre stage in this act.
So far EM equity investors have had to deal with weak earnings and a low return on equity.
The pain in EM corporate credit will begin with a lag, but it is very likely to demand more than its pound of flesh.
And the collateral damage will be broader and may last longer than in developed markets.
Over the past few months, we've interviewed management experts from across Asia.
They've worked in a wide range of industries from fashion to finance, advertizing to airlines.
There were several common themes. -- Asia has great potential, but manage your expectations -- nobody gets rich overnight.

The basic legal framework for IP protection has been there. What we have seen develop over time is not so much better laws, but better enforcement. That's much to the credit of not only the Chinese government, but also the domestic companies that have pushed the whole area as they are the ones who need IP protection as much as we do as they became multinational. As those domestic industries have matured, all the infrastructure that goes with making them globally competitive has come along with it.

One of the major challenges we face in emerging markets is piracy. The primary reason why people pirate is because of the initial up-front cost of perpetual licensing. It's not that they're evil, it's just that the value proposition of piracy is stronger. If you turn that on its head and say $2 per user per month and you can get email as a business -- that's much easier to consume than the up-front cost of a perpetual licensing agreement.
Investor sentiment towards China has undergone an extraordinary shift from exuberance to caution in just two weeks     but the swing may be overdone, says Jing Ulrich, managing director and chairman of China equities and commodities at JPMorgan.
"A fortnight ago, the mood among institutions could only be described as maximum bullish'," she says. "Now, investors have turned extremely wary given China's move towards tightening and the forceful measures being employed to curb inflation."
Ms Ulrich says talk of price controls recalls 2008, when China controlled food prices, capped coal costs and delayed power tariff adjustments.
"These actions helped set a negative tone for Chinese equities," she says. "But this time around, China's economic fundamentals are strong, earnings forecast revisions have been on an uptrend and inflationary pressures, while worrying, are not as intense as in 2008.
"The authorities know higher interest rates may heighten capital inflows, so will instead rely heavily on reserve ratio requirement hikes, open market operations and capital controls to counter asset price inflation.
The New York Stock Exchange, the cornerstone of American capitalism for 220 years, agreed to be sold as part of an $8.2 billion takeover by IntercontinentalExchange Inc.
The takeover also would seal the triumph of electronic trading over open outcry  floor trading that long dominated financial markets, as well as the push by exchanges to embrace new and lucrative kinds of trading.
But it is too late to stop the erosion of the Big Board's clout. So far this year, the iconic trading floor has handled just 20% of all trading volume in NYSE-listed stocks, down from more than 40% in 2007, according to analysts at Sandler O'Neill + Partners LP.
The trading floor is going to become like the Roman Forum,  said Wall Street historian Charles Geisst, a Manhattan College finance professor. It'll be a nice place to visit, but nothing much will go on there.
The proposed takeover also comes as new regulations are changing how Wall Street trades complex derivatives tied to the value of underlying stocks, commodities and other securities.
ICE's main business is energy-futures trading, and executives have long coveted NYSE's London-based Liffe, its prized U.K. futures market.
The pie is shrinking, and their slice of it is shrinking,  said Justin Schack, managing director and partner of New York brokerage firm Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,??..........
ICE and NYSE both failed to pull off separate mergers in the past year and a half.
ICE tried jointly with Nasdaq OMX Group to buy NYSE for about $11 billion and split it up, and NYSE attempted to merge with Deutsche Boerse AG.
In a telephone interview with the Journal on Thursday conducted jointly with NYSE chief Duncan Niederauer, ICE founder and Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said he tried hard to scuttle the planned NYSE-Deutsche Boerse merger last year, and didn't know if my friendship with Duncan would survive or not.
Soon after, following an ICE earnings call, Mr. Niederauer shot him an email: Congrats,  it said.
Good call.
He realized it was business,  Mr. Sprecher said Thursday.
For months, the chief executives chatted on the phone, lunched together and bantered about merging their businesses.
Things got serious only about eight weeks ago.
Neither ICE nor NYSE wanted the cost or distraction of another failed merger, they said Thursday.
At the same time, said the NYSE chief, You can't just put your head in the sand and say, Wow, we tried once.
In September, at a meeting of the NYSE Euronext board, directors discussed strategy with NYSE management, Mr. Niederauer said.
We should only be talking about things where there is a high certainty of closing  a deal, he recalled being said in that discussion.
The executives decided to evaluate options such as a sale, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.
In the final weeks ahead of the deal, Mr. Niederauer had a pragmatic view: that left as a stand-alone company, NYSE would likely begin to falter within a few years, said one person involved in the discussions.
The executive's attitude was very much about control your destiny,  this person said.
The sale of London Metal Exchange operator LME Holdings Ltd., announced in June, brought that sentiment into sharper focus, people with knowledge of the discussions said.
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. bought LME Holdings for about $2.2 billion this month, a price almost double what the sellers had initially thought it would fetch, according to one person familiar with LME's thinking.
NYSE executives believed that Liffe -- the European derivatives business that came with the Big Board's merger with Euronext in 2007 -- alone could be worth the roughly $6 billion market capitalization at that time of the entire NYSE Euronext, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Advisers for NYSE Euronext, including boutique bank Perella Weinberg Partners, studied the feasibility of combinations with other exchange operators, including a preliminary exploration with CME Group Inc., but the company quickly decided that a merger with ICE would present the least amount of risk, the people familiar those deliberations said.
In early October, ICE and NYSE Euronext began serious, one-on-one negotiations, said people with knowledge of the talks.
The two CEOs, who led much of the talks, reached an agreement on the per-share price range by phone, one of the people said.
The merger agreement was drawn up in New York, where NYSE is based, and Atlanta, where ICE is based.
About six weeks ago, Mr. Niederauer and his team drew up a timetable that culminated in a planned announcement on Dec 20th, people familiar with the matter said.
He chose that date based partly on the timing of meetings with regulators in Europe and elsewhere, they added.
They both really need each other,  said Neal Wolkoff, former chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange, which was bought by NYSE in 2008, who now is consultant and lawyer with Richardson & Patel LLP.
As for NYSE, the dominance of high-frequency traders, which make rapid-fire trades using complex computer programs, has forced cost-cutting and lowered exchanges' profits, while a lot of stock trading has moved off exchanges altogether.
Mr. Wolkoff said he expects ICE to shake up NYSE's culture by cutting costs and putting much less focus on appearance of business and the ritual of the floor.
By the time the NYSE started to catch up, it was too late,  said Georges Ugeux, a former European executive of NYSE and now a consultant in New York for Galileo Global Advisors. Only in the last few years has it truly become a technology company.
If Apple Inc. vs Samsung Electronics Co. is a battle of the titans, then here is a David and Goliath story.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Although it's the world's biggest motherboard maker and fifth-largest laptop maker by shipments, Asustek -- whose computers are sold under the Asus' brand -- is still unfamiliar to many Western consumers.
While it's far from a sure bet that Asustek can vault past larger tablet competitors such as South Korea's Samsung -- currently the world's second biggest tablet maker by shipments -- analysts say its latest low-priced offerings at least gives it a seat at the big kids' table of the mobile computing realm.
It's also been targeting the U.S. market this year by, for instance, starting up a Twitter presence in May.
Asustek Chief Financial Officer David Chang said Monday that the company expects to ship 12 million Android tablets in 2013, up 90.5% from 6.3 million in 2012.
It expects combined Windows notebook and tablet shipments to grow 7.6% to 24 million units in 2013 from 22.3 million this year.
Mr. Chang says he believes the popularity of seven-inch tablets can boost the company to second place in combined tablet and notebook shipments after Apple next year.
The company's quarterly tablet shipments have tripled since the launch of the Nexus 7 in July.
But analysts say silver medal is still a lofty goal for this little-known Taiwanese company, which takes its name from the hind half of Pegasus, the mythical winged horse.
In the third quarter, Asustek ranked fourth among tablet makers with 8.6% of the market, behind Apple with 50.4%, Samsung with 18.4% and Amazon.com Inc. with 9.0%, according to market researcher IDC.
China will maintain its tightening measures in property sectors next year and continue its efforts to construct affordable housing, state-run media reported Sunday, citing Vice Premier Li Keqiang.
There has been speculation among some economists that authorities may ease controls on the property market if a steep drop in prices threatens economic growth.
Tightening measures in the property sector have had a certain effect,  Mr. Li said. The market is entering a critical period, so we must stick to the policy stance of curbing [the] overly fast increase of housing prices.
The high cost of housing has been a key complaint across the country, and Beijing views the problem as a potential source of social unrest.
Since April 2010, China has launched a raft of measures to curb property prices, including higher down-payments, limits on the number of residences people can own, the introduction of a property tax in some cities and the construction of low-income housing.
Mr. Li also urged local governments to ensure the construction of affordable housing and the quality of such homes.
Construction of affordable housing will give a large boost to consumption and investment, which are key to China amid the global economic slowdown,  Mr. Li said.
The country plans to start construction on 10 million units of public housing this year, as part of its effort to build 36 million units of public housing from 2011 to 2015.
Do not tell Jamie Dimon     who warned he "wouldn't want to see the next JPMorgan Chase be a Chinese company"     but universal banking is gaining traction among mainland Chinese lenders.
Last month, three of China's four largest banks reported annual declines in fourth-quarter earnings for the first time since 2009.
As elsewhere, clouds are gathering: in addition to tougher capital requirements Chinese lenders have to deal with interest-rate deregulation and rising bad loans on the back of an economic slowdown.
That is driving banks to look elsewhere for income, says Zeng Gang, director of bank research at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Finance and Banking.
"Pure lending business is based on interest margins, but with interest-rate liberalisation, margins are shrinking and risks are rising. Intermediary fees are another source of income, with investment bank and wealth management as the main portion."
China, which has traditionally maintained a strict Glass-Steagall-style separation between commercial and investment banking, bans commercial banks from underwriting initial public offerings or acting as broker-dealers in the stock market, the two biggest revenue sources for securities companies.
But bond underwriting, wealth management, M&A advisory and custodial services have all emerged as areas of competition between banks and brokerages.
And last month the China Securities Regulatory Commission stunned markets by announcing it was considering issuing brokerage licences to commercial banks. That sent brokerage stocks, which have outperformed China's red-hot equity market in recent months, plunging.
Analysts say that commercial banks, whose client base and physical branch networks dwarf those of securities companies, would quickly dominate the sector if regulators granted approval.
           However, the spectre of rivals to challenge western counterparts conjured up by JPMorgan's Mr Dimon remains an unlikely one.
While China's banks tower above their global peers by the size of their balance sheets, they lag far behind in terms of revenue from non-lending businesses.
Recent earnings reports show that banks are diversifying.
At Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's largest bank, income from asset management for corporations rose 18 per cent to Rmb14bn , faster than the bank's 12 per cent growth in overall operating income.
Investment banking income, which includes bond underwriting, structured finance, mergers and acquisitions advisory and private equity, rose 3 per cent to Rmb30bn, following 12 per cent growth in 2013.
Yet total non-interest income at ICBC     which includes investment banking, wealth management, bank cards, settlement and other fees     was only 22 per cent of total operating income last year, less than half the 54 per cent ratio at JPMorgan.
Smaller banks are also getting in on the act.
At Ping An Bank, non-interest income                rose 77 per cent, increasing its share in the bank's total operating income by six percentage points to 28 per cent.
Investment banking, custodial services, bill issuance and gold leasing were the main growth drivers, the bank said.
Small and midsized banks are generating fees by packaging off-balance-sheet loans into high-yielding wealth management products.
This is effectively informal debt securitisation for weaker firms unable to access the formal bond market.

Since rapid-fire trading firms now provide many of                the buy and sell orders that support the market, investors are at the mercy of automated systems that can run amok during volatile times, according to Dave Lauer, who last year quit his job as a trader for an elite Chicago high-frequency trading outfit.
Mr. Lauer is part of a growing chorus of industry insiders blowing the whistle on approved trading techniques that they say are designed by the traders who derive the most benefit.
Mr. Lauer is now a consultant on market-structure issues for Better Markets, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group funded by a hedge fund.
High-frequency trading accounts for some two-thirds of all trading       volume, experts say.
The SEC is conducting an inquiry into whether high-frequency firms use those order types to jump in front of other investors.
In a page-one article Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Haim Bodek, who helped run a high-frequency trading firm, told SEC enforcement officials last year that he believed exchanges were giving certain sophisticated trading firms special advantages that helped them beat out other investors.
When Silchester bought into the South China Morning Post, the fund manager was investing in a group once touted as the most profitable newspaper in the world.
Seventeen years later, the media landscape has changed dramatically, but Silchester's investment has not     partly because SCMP Group shares have been frozen since 2013 by Hong Kong rules that allow stocks to languish for years without being traded.
The issue is a source of frustration for investors, particularly given the city's status as Asia's leading stock market and the gateway to China.
"We find the whole saga astounding     we would not expect such an affair in any developed stock market," says Stephen Butt, chairman and chief executive of Silchester International Investors, which holds 14 per cent of SCMP Group.
"Our clients, who include many leading international foundations, endowments and charities, are suffering. Why should their interests be abused in this way and to whose benefit?"
About $12bn of equity capital is trapped in companies that have not traded in at least three months     a number that will more than double if Hanergy Thin Film, frozen for six weeks following its spectacular fall from grace, does not resume trading soon.
Hong Kong is not alone in allowing shares to be suspended     or demanding it if circumstances require     but what sets it apart is the length of time shareholders can be stuck in a deep freeze.
The SCMP Group was suspended in February 2013 after its free float dropped below the 25 per cent minimum required by the exchange.
SCMP Group says its board has frequently discussed possible resolutions and is working closely with regulators and shareholders.
The market value of the trapped capital is likely to grow by a third next week if Tianhe Chemical does not begin trading in the meantime.
           Tianhe's shares rose rapidly after listing last June but it fell foul of short sellers in September, since when its share price has halved.
Suspension leaves would-be sellers reliant on finding a buyer privately as Hong Kong has no equivalent to the US over-the-counter "pink sheets" market.
